            <description source="Walt Whitman Archive">
                <tei:p>The first extant photo of Whitman with anyone else, here Peter Doyle,
                    Whitman's close friend and companion in Washington. Doyle was a horsecar driver
                    and met Whitman one stormy night in 1865 when Whitman, looking (as Doyle said)
                    "like an old sea-captain," remained the only passenger on Doyle's car. They were
                    inseparable for the next eight years. Whitman once dated this photo 1865. </tei:p> <tei:p>In
                    1889, Whitman had a remarkable talk with Horace Traubel and Thomas Harned about
                    the photo; Traubel recalls the conversation: "I picked up a picture from the box
                    by the fire: a Washington picture: W. and Peter Doyle photoed together: a rather
                    remarkable composition: Doyle with a sickly smile on his face: W. lovingly
                    serene: the two looking at each other rather stagily, almost sheepishly. W. had
                    written on this picture, at the top: 'Washington D.C. 1865&#8212;”Walt Whitman
                    &#38; his rebel soldier friend Pete Doyle.' W. laughed heartily the instant I
                    put my hands on it (I had seen it often before)&#8212;”Harned mimicked Doyle, W.
                    retorting: 'Never mind, the expression on my face atones for all that is lacking
                    in his. What do I look like there? Is it seriosity?' Harned suggested:
                    'Fondness, and Doyle should be a girl'&#8212;”but W. shook his head, laughing
                    again: 'No&#8212;”don't be too hard on it: that is my rebel friend, you know,'
                    &#38;c. Then again: 'Tom, you would like Pete&#8212;”love him: and you, too,
                    Horace: you especially, Horace&#8212;”you and Pete would get to be great chums.
                    I found everybody in Washington who knew Pete loving him: so that fond
                    expression, as you call it, Tom, has very good cause for being: Pete is a master
                    character.' I said: 'One of your powerful uneducated persons, Walt, eh?' W.
                    quickly: 'Just that: a rare man: knowing nothing of books, knowing everything of
                    life: a great big hearty full-blooded everyday divinely generous working man: a
                    hail fellow well met&#8212;”a little too fond maybe of his beer, now and then,
                    and of the women: maybe, maybe: but for the most part the salt of the earth.
                    Most literary men, as you know, are the kind of men a hearty man would not go
                    far to see: but Pete fascinates you by the very earthiness of his nobility. O
                    yes, you fellows will know him: you, Horace, must particularly make it your
                    point to come in relations with him: you will know him&#8212;”both of
                    you&#8212;”and then you will understand that what I say is wholly true and yet
                    is short of the truth.'" <tei:ptr
