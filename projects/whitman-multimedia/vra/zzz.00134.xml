            <description source="Walt Whitman Archive"><tei:p>Whitman late in his life identified the date of this photo as between 1845 and 1850, but no one has agreed with him; Dr. Bucke guessed 1856, but most estimates have been a later date. Seeing this photo late in his life, Whitman exclaimed, "How shaggy! looks like a returned Californian, out of the mines, or Coloradoan," but he was fascinated with "the expression of benignity" that shone through, though he felt "such benignity, such sweetness, such satisfiedness&#8212;it does not belong. I know it often appears&#8212;‚Äù but that's the trick of the camera, the photographer." <tei:ptr target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.26.html"/></tei:p><tei:p>Whitman called it his "young man" picture ("when did I not look old? At twenty-five or twenty-six they used already to remark it"), and claimed "it is me, me, un formed, undeveloped&#8212;hits off phases not common in my photos."<tei:ptr target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.27.html"/>He described his physique at the time: "I was very much slenderer then: weighed from one hundred and fifty-five to one hundred and sixty-five pounds: had kept that weight for about thirty years: then got heavier." Whitman was amused by the clothing&#8212;"how natural the clothes! . . . the suit was a beautiful misfit, as usual, eh?"&#8212;and he was impressed with "its calm don't-care-a-damnativeness&#8212;its go-to-hell-and-find-outativeness: it has that air strong, yet is not impertinent: defiant: yet it is genial."</tei:p><tei:p>Whitman was mystified by this portrait&#8212;he began calling it "the mysterious photograph"&#8212;when he first saw it in 1889: "When it could have been taken&#8212;by whom&#8212;where&#8212;I cannot even guess. . . . it's a devilish, tantalizing mystery. . . ."</tei:p><tei:p>A copy in the Library of Congress notes (in Traubel's handwriting): "The only photographic copy of this picture known is in the possession of McKay, Phila. Used by W.W. In the pocket Edition of L of G. 1889." An engraving of the J. W. Black photograph appeared in "Walt Whitman," New York Illustrated News 2 (2 June 1860), 60.</tei:p></description>
