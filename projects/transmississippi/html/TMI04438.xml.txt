   <p>THE LITTLE SOD SHANTY ON THE PLAINS.</p>
   <p>A TRANS-MISSISSIPPI SONG.</p>
   <p>Words and Music by MORTE PARSONS.</p>
   <p>Copyrighted 1898.</p>
   <p>Far away out west, upon Nebraska's prairies,</p>
   <p>We came nigh thirty happy years ago;</p>
   <p>Since then my wife and I have been a toiling</p>
   <p>From morn til night in summer and in snow.</p>
   <p>We've not been very stylish or progressive,</p>
   <p>Nor travelled much to spend our scanty gains;</p>
   <p>We have labored hard, yet lived in health and plenty</p>
   <p>In our little old shanty on the plains.</p>
   <p>You may sing of love in bardic story, olden,</p>
   <p>Or the meadow's breath, sweet scented with the rains,</p>
   <p>But you ne'er can sweep the mem'ries sweet and golden,</p>
   <p>From the little old sod shanty on the plains.</p>
   <p>But...... now the times have changed out in Nebraska;</p>
   <p>That old shanty mouldered in the long ago;</p>
   <p>We have now a mansion large enough for twenty</p>
   <p>Of our relative and friends who come and go;</p>
   <p>And we're going to have the grandest Exposition</p>
   <p>That this busy, gay old world has ever seen,</p>
   <p>And they're coming, for we give to them a welcome</p>
   <p>To the gates of Omaha, Nebraska's Queen." </p>
   <p>You may sing and talk of fairs and expositions,</p>
   <p>Of the war and brutal conduct of old Spain,</p>
   <p>But the world had better look for transportation</p>
   <p>To the Trans-Mississippi on the plains."</p>
