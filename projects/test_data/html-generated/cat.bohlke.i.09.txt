      <h3>1921: OMAHA</h3>
      
      <div class="byline">Introduction by L. Brent Bohlke </div>
      
      <p>A longer 
         <span class="roman">World-Herald</span> interview by Eva Mahoney was published three weeks
         after the others that resulted from Cather's visit to Omaha; meanwhile, Cather had
         gone to
         Lincoln. This interview stresses the importance of friendship for Willa Cather. It
         traces
         Cather's meteoric rise in the literary world and recounts, again, the shifting emphasis
         in
         her fiction. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Eva Mahoney, a native of Omaha, joined the staff of the 
         <span class="roman">World-Herald</span> in
         1917. For many years she edited the "Mary Lane" column, advice for the lovelorn,
         and went on to have responsibilities in women's news, general news, and feature writing.
         She retired to Tucson in 1954, where she died in 1968.
      </p>
      
      <p>Miss Mahoney recalled the effect of Sinclair Lewis's speech (see "1921 Red
         Cloud") and uses a great deal of Dorothy Canfield Fisher's 
         <span class="roman">Yale Review</span>
         article. The interview is well known and often quoted.

   <h4>HOW WILLA CATHER FOUND HERSELF</h4>
   
   <h4>After Ten Years of Practice at Following Henry James' Style,

   <p>When one starts out to write about Willa Sibert Cather, distinguished Nebraska
      novelist, he must approach his subject with simplicity and sincerity. If he does not
      he
      will sin not only against the canons of art but against Miss Cather's highest ideals,
      for
      sincerity and simplicity are the fundamental characteristics of this gifted writer
      and of
      the art of literature as she so beautifully interprets it. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Cather spent several days in Omaha late in October at which time she spoke before
      the Omaha Society of Fine Arts and the Nebraska League of Women Voters. She has been
      going
      through Omaha from New York City on her way to her home in Red Cloud, Neb., for the
      last
      twenty years but she never stopped off here. She is going to stop off every time from
      now
      on, she says, because she renewed some old friendships and made some new ones while
      here.
      And Miss Cather is just that homey sort of a person who loves her friends—not social
      acquaintances—but friends. That's why she has been coming back each year to Nebraska
      to visit her father and mother and her friends—to see the people and the things with
      which she is familiar.
   </p>
   
   <p>And that fact more than any one thing accounts for the success that has come to Miss
      Cather as a writer. She tells about people and things with which she is familiar.
   </p>
   
   <p>She did not always do this. For more than ten years after her graduation from the
      University of Nebraska at the age of 19, she wrote about things that she knew only
      superficially, she says. And success evaded her. Then her pen poised for an interval
      and
      when it dropped again to paper it did so to record the story of life in Nebraska as
      lived
      by those sturdy pioneer farmers near Saline and Webster and Franklin counties. She
      had
      known these people from childhood, and she had heard stories of their early struggles
      by
      word of mouth, and so she wrote about them.
   </p>
   
   <p>The voices of those Scandinavian and Bohemian farmers had heretofore remained mute
      in
      the literature of this nation. Their joys and their sorrows; their loves and their
      hates;
      their failures and their successes no one had put into words. But they found their
      spokesman at last in 
      <em>O Pioneers!</em>, and well they had been repaid for their long
      silence. They had been immortalized. Critics of two continents proclaimed Miss Cather
      a
      superb artist and assigned 
      <em>0 Pioneers!</em> to its rightful place among the great
      literatures of the world.
   </p>
   
   <p>The critics had spoken. They were unanimous in their praise, but Miss Cather waited
      a
      bit breathlessly to hear from her reading public. And then her reading public spoke
      and in
      no uncertain terms. Letters poured in from the Danes, Swedes, Germans, and Bohemians
      from
      all over the state, letters of praise and gratitude that a great artist had portrayed
      their lives truthfully and lovingly. 
   </p>
   
   <p>And then Willa Cather knew that she had come into her own—that she had done a new
      sort of thing in American literature. She had treated a new subject in a language
      that her
      subject gave her. Years before Miss Cather's good friend and critic, the late Sarah
      Orne
      Jewett, the writer, divining the Nebraska woman's mental conflict, had said: "What
      you really care for is new material that has never been used. Don't write about other
      things. If you have to create a new medium, have the courage to do it."
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Cather had the courage to do just this thing. The result is that many critics
      proclaim her the foremost woman novelist in America today. Some critics do not qualify
      their statement but say unreservedly that she is the foremost novelist in America.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      <em>O Pioneers!</em> was not Miss Cather's first novel, but it was her first one that
      made the world sit up and take notice. Her first book was a collection of stories,
      
      <em>The
         Troll Garden
      </em>. In 1912, she published her first novel, 
      <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>.
      Before this she had written a volume of light verse, 
      <em>April Twilights</em>, and many
      stories for magazines. In fact, back in the files of the college magazine of the
      University of Nebraska can be found honest but cumbersome efforts on Miss Cather's
      part to
      tell in story something of the lives of those early settlers who had lived near her
      father's farm near Red Cloud. Amateurish though these stories were, perhaps they pointed
      the way to the heights toward which Miss Cather was traveling, her friends say.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      <em>The Song of the Lark</em> was published next. Critics accorded it high praise but
      were less of one opinion regarding its merit. Miss Cather, herself, cares less for
      it than
      for any of her books, although she admits frankly that she enjoyed writing it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Then came 
      <em>My Ántonia</em>, conceded by many to be her masterpiece. She had been
      three years writing this book as she had in writing 
      <em>The Song of the Lark</em>. When H.
      L. Mencken, most caustic of American critics, read 
      <em>My Ántonia</em>, he declared it to
      be the best piece of fiction done by any woman in America. 
   </p>
   
   <p>"Ántonia was a Bohemian girl who had been kind to me when I was a child,"
      says Miss Cather simply in speaking about this striking character in fiction.
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Cather's latest book, 
      <em>Youth and the Bright Medusa</em>, is a collection of short
      stories, some of them rewritten from an earlier period.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nebraska people, except those about whom she has actually written, have been backward
      in coming to a full realization that a literary genius was taking the trouble to write
      about their state. It is a bit humiliating to admit, but such is the case. The great
      centers of the United States and other countries had paid their highest tribute to
      Miss
      Cather long before this state awakened to its great opportunity to proclaim its own
      prophet.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is true the University of Nebraska translated into Czech 
      <em>O Pioneers!</em> at the
      time it was published, but the recognition did not spread much further. While Nebraska
      was
      dilatory, the remainder of the world was not. 
      <em>O Pioneers!</em> was serialized in a daily
      paper in Norway; conservative Scandinavian critics wrote in high praise of the book;
      now
      all Miss Cather's books have been translated into the Scandinavian and 
      <em>My Ántonia</em>
      has been translated in Prague, Czecho-Slovakia. All her books are now being translated
      into French, and Miss Cather goes to Paris next summer to aid in this work of translation.
   </p>
   
   <p>And so the world is proclaiming Miss Cather's literary triumph. Yet it took Sinclair
      Lewis, that big, boyish, jubilant author of 
      <em>Main Street</em>, who came lecturing here
      last winter, to tell Omaha people very emphatically just how great a writer Willa
      Cather
      is. 
   </p>
   
   <p>"Miss Cather is Nebraska's foremost citizen," declared Sinclair in his
      positive way. "The United States knows Nebraska because of Willa Cather's books.
      "
   </p>
   
   <p>It was not until Sinclair Lewis issued his militant proclamation that Miss Cather's
      own
      father, C. F. Cather of Red Cloud, knew just how brilliant a daughter he had given
      to the
      world. At that time he wrote a loving little letter to his daughter in New York and
      in it
      paid a tribute to her genius, a bit awkwardly put, for full realization had come to
      the
      father with rather startling force.
   </p>
   
   <p>"Father is a very modest man, and he wants me to be modest," said Miss Cather
      when in Omaha recently, and the phrase had in it nothing of affectation, for success
      has
      left Miss Cather without affectation, modest and unspoiled, just as her father would
      have
      her. And then it was that all the rest of the Cather family rejoiced, and as Miss
      Cather
      is one of seven children, "all living and hale and hearty," as she says, the
      rejoicing was widespread.
   </p>
   
   <p>This sketch about Miss Cather's success sounds quite simple in the telling. She seems
      to have moved unimpeded along the path to achievement. Actually this is far from the
      truth. With her as with most people, success represents a terrific struggle. It represents
      years of youthful uncertainty and mental chaos when she was learning her technique
      and
      learning also the ways of the world in this country and abroad. Studying and working
      and
      striving to express herself, Miss Cather wrote for magazines, did newspaper work on
      the
      Pittsburg 
      <em>Leader</em>, taught English in an Allegheny high school, was editor of 
      <em>McClure's</em>
      magazine, and in other ways served the hard apprenticeship that precedes a great literary
      triumph.
   </p>
   
   <p>When she tells about those years there comes into her voice an occasional
      break—that is the only sign of emotion, for Miss Cather has about her nothing of
      foolish sentimentality, although she has a penetrating warmth of genuine sentiment.
      But
      she wants it known that she has had a good time during those years of struggle; that
      she
      was happy in her travels, her love of music, her friends, her work—but happiness in
      her actual achievement was long deferred.
   </p>
   
   <p>"A book is made with one's own flesh and blood of years. It is cremated youth. It
      is all yours—no one gave it to you," said Miss Cather when speaking of her work
      in Omaha, and the quiet solemnity of a beautifully modulated voice, the sensitive
      play of
      emotion on her delicately chiseled face gave force to her words and made one realize
      just
      how much more than mere craftsmanship goes into the making of a great book.
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Cather tells about those years of tireless effort as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"When I left the University of Nebraska after graduating and went to New York
      City, I wanted to write after the best style of Henry James —the foremost mind that
      ever applied itself to literature in America. I was dazzled. I was trying to work
      in a
      sophisticated medium and write about highly developed people whom I knew only
      superficially.
   </p>
   
   <p>"It was during the six years when I was editor of 
      <em>McClure's</em> magazine that I
      came to have a definite idea about writing. In reading manuscripts submitted to me,
      I
      found that 95 per cent of them were written for the sake of the writer never for the
      sake
      of the material. The writer wanted to express his clever ideas, his wit, his observations.
      Almost never did I find a manuscript that was written because a writer loved his subject
      so much he had to write about it.
   </p>
   
   <p>"Usually," she added, "when I did get such a manuscript it was so crude
      it was ineffective. Then I realized that one must have two things—strong enough to
      mate together without either killing the other—else one had better change his job.
      I
      learned that a man must have a technique and a birthright to write—I do not know how
      else to express it. He must know his subject with an understanding that passes
      understanding—like the babe knows its own mother's breast."
   </p>
   
   <p>It was through this critical analysis of story writing that Miss Cather finally found
      herself. "I had been trying to sing a song that did not lie in my voice," Miss
      Cather declared. 
   </p>
   
   <p>"There I was on the Atlantic coast among dear and helpful friends and surrounded
      by the great masters and teachers with all their tradition of learning and culture,
      and
      yet I was always being pulled back into Nebraska," she continued. "Whenever I
      crossed the Missouri river coming into Nebraska the very smell of the soil tore me
      to
      pieces. I could not decide which was the real and which the fake 'me.' I almost decided
      to
      settle down on a quarter section of land and let my writing go. My deepest affection
      was
      not for the other people and the other places I had been writing about. I loved the
      country where I had been a kid, where they still called me 'Willie' Cather.
   </p>
   
   <p>"I knew every farm, every tree, every field in the region around my home, and they
      all called out to me," she added earnestly. "My deepest feelings were rooted in
      this country because one's strongest emotions and one's most vivid mental pictures
      are
      acquired before one is 15. I had searched for books telling about the beauty of the
      country I loved, its romance, and heroism and strength and courage of its people that
      had
      been plowed into the very furrows of its soil, and I did not find them. And so I wrote
      
      <em>O
         Pioneers!
      </em>."
   </p>
   
   <p>And in the writing of this book and the other books that followed, Willa Cather saw
      all
      those early years had been in preparation for her rightful task. Out of her experience
      with complex people and complex things had come a great work of literature about simple
      people and simple things. 
   </p>
   
   <p>This, too, Sarah Orne Jewett had epitomized for Miss Cather when she said to her:
      "You have to know the world so well before you know the parish," and so after
      coming to know the world, Miss Cather went back home and wrote about the parish.
   </p>
   
   <p>Another literary friend, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, has recently written in the 
      <em>Yale
         Review 
      </em>in unreserved praise of Miss Cather's work. Strangely enough Miss Cather and
      Mrs. Fisher were schoolmates at the University of Nebraska, and now both are writers
      of
      national distinction. Mrs. Fisher wrote as follows: 
   </p>
   
   <p>"There is no writer living in whose excellence Americans feel a warmer, prouder
      pleasure than we all feel in the success of Willa Cather. I do not mean by success
      the
      wide recognition given her, although that is delightful to see. I mean what must give
      much
      more satisfaction to Miss Cather, herself, her real inner success, her real excellence,
      her firm, steady upward growth and expansion into tranquil and assured power. It is
      as
      heartening and inspiring a spectacle as the rich, healthful growth and flowering into
      splendor of a plant in our gardens, for she is a plant of our own American garden
      to her
      last fiber. 
   </p>
   
   <p>"Here is an American to whom European culture (and she has always had plenty of
      that) is but food to be absorbed and transformed into a new product, quite different,
      unique, inimitable, with a harmonious perfection of its own. I cannot imagine any
      exercise which would be of more use to a young writer than to take the last story
      in her
      new volume, 
      <em>Youth and the Bright Medusa</em> (what an inspired title!), and compare it
      line by line with the original version which was published in the January number of
      
      <em>Scribner's</em>
      in 1903. The whole story of Miss Cather's development is there, and an uninformed
      writer
      would learn more by pondering on the changes made by Miss Cather in her own story
      after
      eighteen years of growth and work than by listening to many lectures from the professors
      of literature.
   </p>
   
   <p>"So often writers, even very clever ones, spoil their earlier work when they try
      to alter it, have not the firm mastery of their craft to know how to smooth out the
      crudeness without rooting out the life, are so startled by the changes in their own
      taste
      that they do not know where to begin. Miss Cather, conscious, firm-willed artist that
      she
      is, has known just where to lay her finger on the false passages and how to lift them
      without destroying the life of the story."
   </p>
   
   <p>In her New York home, Miss Cather works but three hours a day—hours of perfect joy
      and happiness, she describes them. She finds that at the end of two or three hours
      she has
      exhausted her best efforts. She spends the remainder of the day with her friends,
      or
      taking a walk in Central park, or listening to good music or busying herself with
      housework and forgets about her work. She believes that a writer should keep in as
      good
      physical condition as a singer, and so she regulates her life on a simple, normal
      schedule. She writes easily and seldom tears a paragraph or a page to pieces. She
      sometimes revises, but she does not fuss over her writing. "I let life flow along
      the
      pages," says this consummate artist.
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Cather has just completed a new book, 
      <em>One of Ours</em>. It is now in proof form.
      She worked three years on this book, and she considers it her best effort. 
   </p>
   
   <p>"The hero is just a red-headed prairie boy," said Miss Cather. "I always
      felt it was presumptuous and silly for a woman to write about a male character, but
      by a
      chain of circumstances I came to know that boy better than I know myself. I have cut
      out
      all descriptive work in this book—the thing I do best. I have cut out all picture
      making because that boy does not see pictures. It was hard to cease to do the thing
      that I
      do best, but we all have to pay the price for everything we accomplish, and because
      I was
      willing to pay so much to write about this boy, I felt that I had a right to do so."
   </p>
   
   <p>Lucky prairie boy! To have Willa Cather to write about him. </p>
