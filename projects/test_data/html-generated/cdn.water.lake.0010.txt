      <h3>GEDDES NEWS:</h3>
      
      
      <p> C. C. Smith called Monday and ordered the News sent to him at Lake Andes where Mr.
         and Mrs. Smith will reside in the future. They have been residents of Geddes for the
         part year and have made many friends while here who will unite in wishing them happiness
         at their new home near the lake.

      <p> The water in Lake Andes is the highest it has ever been, to our knowledge, and it
         is raising at the rate of two inches a month. The four artesian wells and the rains
         has made it a beautiful body of water. There must be places in the lake where the
         water is nearly or quite 30 feet deep. From now on it will be a great Lake for fish.
