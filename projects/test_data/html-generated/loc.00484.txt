The contents of this notebook were written during Whitman's hospital visits to wounded
soldiers. The dated entries are from mid-1863, and the other notes probably date to
about the same time. The prose narrative at the beginning probably describes the battle
of White Oak Swamp and is the basis for the poem "A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest,
and the Road Unknown," which first appeared in Drum-Taps (1865).

Hospital Note Book Walt Whitman




This prose narrative (probably describing the battle of White Oak Swamp) is the basis for the poem "A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown,"
which first appeared in Drum-Taps(1865). 





scene in the woods on the peninsula—told me by Milton Roberts, ward G (Maine)
after the battle of White Oaks church, on the retreat, the march at night—the scene
between 12 &amp; 2 o'clock that night at the church in the woods, the hospital show at
night, the wounded brought in—previous the silent stealthy march through the woods,
at times stumbling over the bodies of dead men in the road, (there had been terrible
fighting there 



the 
that 

day, only closing at dark)—we retreating the 
artillery horses feet muffled. orders that men should tread light &amp; only speak in whispers—
Then between 
12 
midnight 
 &amp; 1 oclock we halted to rest a couple of hours at an opening in the woods—in this
opening was a pretty good sized old church used improm impromptu for a hospital for the wounded of the 

 battles of the day thereabout—with these it was filled, all varieties, horrible beyond
description—
—the darkness dimly lit with candles, lamps, torches, moving about, but dark but plenty of darkness &amp; half darkness.—the crowds of wounded, bloody &amp; pale, the
surgeons operating—the yards outside also filled—they lay on the ground 
some on blankets, some on stray planks, 
or

 —the desp despairing screams &amp; curses of some out of their senses, 
the murky darkness, the 
great gleaming of the torches, the smoke from them too, 
the doctors operating, the scent of chloroform, the glisten of the steel instruments


as 
as 
the flash of lamps fell upon them

after 
at 
Antietam there was a very large barn &amp; farm house—the barn was filled with wounded,
&amp; the barn yard, 
an the 
farm house as full as it could stick—a peaceful barn, 
now bloody the fragrant hay they used to place the men on for operations—they turned the cattle
out of their stalls
