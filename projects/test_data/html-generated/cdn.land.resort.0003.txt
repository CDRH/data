   <p>Geddes Free Lance: Ye editor visited Lake Andes last Monday and he
      was impressed with the splendid growth the new town has made since 
      it started. The main street is almost solidly built up, only now
      and then a vacant lot. Some as fine residents as you can find in the
      county, and cement sidewalks. The business men all seem to be doing
      a fine business. It contains two banks, a drugstore furniture store,
      three livery barns, one church, one meat market, several pool rooms,
      two hotels and no saloons. Upon the whole it is a nice town 
      beautifully located affording a fine view of the lake. We predict a 
      bright future for Lake Andes.
