      <p>Born a slave to his mulatto mother, Miss Kill,
         and plantation owner Sir Jennings Beckwith
         on April 26, 1798, in Fredericksburg, Virginia,
         James Pierson Beckwourth became a famous
         African American mountain man. In 1810 the
         Beckwiths moved to St. Louis, where Beckwourth
         received his freedom. He joined Gen.
         William H. Ashley's fur-trapping expedition
         to the Rocky Mountains in 1824, working as a
         horse buyer, blacksmith, and trapper. Beckwourth
         fought against the Blackfeet in 1827–28, 
         before being adopted into Crow chief Big
         Bowl's band. He married several Crow women
         while working as a trader for Kenneth McKenzie
         and the American Fur Company in the
         1830s.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Beckwourth served under the command of
         Gen. Zachary Taylor in the Second Seminole
         War in Florida in 1836–37, worked as a trader
         for Andrew Sublette and Louis Vasquez along
         the Santa Fe Trail at Bent's Fort and Taos,
         and married a Spanish woman. In 1842 he
         built a trading post on the Arkansas River and
         founded the settlement of Pueblo, Colorado.
         He raided horses from Mexican ranchos, participated
         in the California insurrection in
         1845–46, joined the gold rush in 1848, and
         opened a trail, later known as Beckwourth
         Pass, through the Sierras.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>His 1854 account of his life earned him a
         reputation as a liar because he exaggerated his
         role in many events. He later supplied miners
         in the Pikes Peak gold rush and guided the
         army in the Sand Creek Massacre. After serving
         as scout at Fort Laramie, Beckwourth returned
         to live among the Crows, where he
         died in 1866.
