Washington, Sept. 29, 1865
           

The acting Secretary of the Interior, Judge Wm. T. Otto, stopt on his way to cabinet meeting, called at the Att'y Gen's Office, &amp; on business, &amp; stopt at my desk a moment.  He said to Mr. W., "I hope you are well situated here—I am was sorry to have lost lose your services in our Department, as for I considered them rel valuable. Your dismissal The affair was" ( my dismissal) "was settled upon before I knew of it."

In the course of some the a brief conversation, then &amp; there the question was asked him Mr. Otto about of the particular volume copy of "Leaves of Grass" which Mr. Harlan had as in his room, as alluded to in his conversation with the Ass't Atty Gen if whether it was a volume bound in blue paper covers, —&amp; any thing like one this—(showing him pointing to a volume of Leaves paper bound, about the same thickness but octavo. &amp; He said he had had no special conference with Mr. Harlan on the volume. (a 500 page paper bound vol. lying on the my table was shown him, &amp; asked if it was such a vol.  He said that he had seen a volume of Leaves he had seen on Mr. Harlan's desk, a volume of Leaves of Grass, in blue paper covers, &amp; the pages of the conten poems marked more or less all through the book, had been shown him, he thinks by one of the clerks, but he had paid no particular
attention to; but he remembered seeing that a blue paper covered copy on Mr. Harlan’s desk; he remembers this volume being shown him &amp; opened by some one who saw on his, Mr. O's, table a copy of Drum Taps.
