My dear Walt


i have waited and waited to hear from you and have got no word from you since you
left which seems so strange that i feel quite uneasy
for fear something is the matter i may get a letter this afternoon but i
cant
can't
conceeve
conceive why i have not heard from you you are so
promt
prompt to write and i wanted so to hear of your safe arrival
it is very warm here to day uncomfortably so Edd has
been quite sick with his eye and face all swoln
swollen up so he could not see

he has taken some medicine and is some better to day Walt where is all the Drum taps we
have looked all over for one or two i thought you left some up stairs but
cant
can't find one i had one of the
first ones on the table here and i cant
can't find it i used to read some in it almost every night
before i went to Bed
you must write just as quick as you get this no more but write


your mother
L Whitman


did you get the paper the new yorker
