         <h4>Preface</h4>
         
         <p>T
            <span class="smallcaps">HE</span> objective of the Willa Cather Scholarly Edition is to provide to
            readers—present and future—various kinds of information
            relevant to Willa Cather's writing, obtained and presented according to the
            highest scholarly standards: a critical text faithful to her intention as she
            prepared it for the first edition, a historical essay providing relevant
            biographical and historical facts, explanatory notes identifying allusions and
            references, a textual commentary tracing the work through its lifetime and
            describing Cather's involvement with it, and a record of changes in the text's
            various editions. This edition is distinctive in the comprehensiveness of its
            apparatus, especially in its inclusion of extensive explanatory information that
            illuminates the fiction of a writer who drew so extensively upon actual
            experience, as well as the full textual information we have come to expect in a
            modern critical edition. It thus connects activities that are too often
            separate—literary scholarship and textual editing. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Editing Cather's writing means recognizing that Cather was as fiercely protective
            of her novels as she was of her private life. She suppressed much of her early
            writing and dismissed serial publication of her later work, discarded manuscripts
            and proofs,
            destroyed letters, and included in her will a stipulation against publication of
            her private papers. Yet the record remains surprisingly full. Manuscripts,
            typescripts, and proofs of some texts survive with corrections and revisions in
            Cather's hand; serial publications provide final "draft" versions of texts;
            correspondence with her editors and publishers helps clarify her intention for a
            work, and publishers' records detail each book's public life; correspondence
            with friends and acquaintances provides an intimate view of her writing;
            published interviews with and speeches by Cather provide a running commentary on
            her career; and through their memoirs, recollections, and letters, Cather's
            contemporaries provide their own commentary on circumstances surrounding her
            writing. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In assembling pieces of the editorial puzzle, we have been guided by principles
            and procedures articulated by the Committee on Scholarly Editions of the Modern
            Language Association. Assembling and comparing texts demonstrated the basic
            tenet of the textual editor—that only painstaking collations reveal
            what is actually there. Scholars had assumed, for example, that with the
            exception of a single correction in spelling, 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em> passed
            unchanged from the 1913 first edition to the 1937 Autograph Edition. Collations
            revealed nearly a hundred word changes, thus providing information not only
            necessary to establish a critical text and to interpret how Cather composed but
            also basic to interpreting how her ideas about art changed as she matured. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather's revisions and corrections on typescripts and page proofs demonstrate
            that she brought to her own writing her extensive experience as an editor. Word
            changes demonstrate her practices in revising; other changes demonstrate that
            she gave extraordinarily close scrutiny to such matters as capitalization,
            punctuation, paragraphing, hyphenation, and spacing. Knowledgeable about
            production, Cather had intentions for her books that extended to their design
            and manufacture. For example, she specified typography, illustrations, page
            format, paper stock, ink color, covers, wrappers, and advertising copy. 
         </p>
         
         <p>To an exceptional degree, then, Cather gave to her work the close textual
            attention that modern editing practices respect, while in other ways she
            challenged her editors to expand the definition of "corruption" and
            "authoritative" beyond the text, to include the book's whole format and material
            existence. Believing that a book's physical form influenced its
            relationship with a reader, she selected type, paper, and format that invited
            the reader response she sought. The heavy texture and cream color of paper used
            for 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em> and 
            <em>My Ántonia</em>, for example, created a
            sense of warmth and invited a childlike play of imagination, as did these books'
            large, dark type and wide margins. By the same principle, she expressly rejected
            the anthology format of assembling texts of numerous novels within the covers of
            one volume, with tight margins, thin paper, and condensed print. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Given Cather's explicitly stated intentions for her works, printing and
            publishing decisions that disregard her wishes represent their own form of corruption,
            and an authoritative edition of Cather
            must go beyond the sequence of words and punctuation to include other matters:
            page format, paper stock, typeface, and other features of design. The volumes in
            the Cather Edition respect those intentions insofar as possible within a series
            format that includes a comprehensive scholarly apparatus. For example, the
            Cather Edition has adopted the format of six by nine inches, which Cather
            approved in Bruce Rogers's elegant work on the 1937 Houghton Mifflin
            Autograph Edition, to accommodate the various elements of design. While lacking
            something of the intimacy of the original page, this size permits the use of
            large, generously leaded type and ample margins—points of style upon
            which the author was so insistent. In the choice of paper we have deferred to
            Cather's declared preference for a warm, cream antique stock. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Today's technology makes it difficult to emulate the qualities of hot-metal
            typesetting and letterpress printing. In comparison, modern phototypesetting
            printed by offset lithography tends to look anemic and lacks the tactile quality
            of type impressed into the page. The version of the typeface employed in the
            original edition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, were it available for
            phototypesetting, would hardly survive the transition. Instead, we have chosen
            Linotype Janson Text, a modern rendering of the type used by Rogers. The subtle
            adjustments of stroke weight in this reworking do much to retain the integrity
            of earlier metal versions. Therefore, without trying to replicate the design of
            single works, we seek to represent Cather's general preferences in a design that encompasses
            many
            volumes. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In each volume in the Cather Edition, the author's specific intentions for design
            and printing are set forth in textual commentaries. These essays also describe
            the history of the texts, identify those that are authoritative, explain the
            selection of copy-texts or basic texts, justify emendations of the copy-text,
            and describe patterns of variants. The textual apparatus in each
            volume—lists of variants, emendations, explanations of emendations,
            and end-line hyphenations— completes the textual story. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Historical essays provide essential information about the genesis, form, and
            transmission of each book, as well as supply its biographical, historical, and
            intellectual contexts. Illustrations supplement these essays with photographs,
            maps, and facsimiles of manuscript, typescript, or typeset pages. Finally,
            because Cather in her writing drew so extensively upon personal experience and
            historical detail, explanatory notes are an especially important part of the
            Cather Edition. By providing a comprehensive identification of her references to
            flora and fauna, to regional customs and manners, to the classics and
            the Bible, to popular writing, music, and other arts—as well as
            relevant cartography and census material—these notes provide a
            starting place for scholarship and criticism on subjects long slighted or
            ignored. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Within this overall standard format, differences occur that are informative in
            their own right. The straightforward textual history of 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em> and
            
            <em>My Ántonia</em> contrasts with the more complicated textual challenges of 
            <em>A Lost Lady</em> and 
            <em>Death Comes
               for the Archbishop
            </em>; the allusive personal history of the Nebraska
            novels, so densely woven that 
            <em>My Ántonia</em> seems drawn not
            merely upon Anna Pavelka but upon all of Webster County, contrasts with the more
            public allusions of novels set elsewhere. The Cather Edition reflects
            the individuality of each work while providing a standard reference for critical
            study.

         <p>L
            <span class="smallcaps">ATE</span> one brilliant April afternoon  
            <a href="en2" id="en2.ref" class="footnote">Professor Lucius Wilson</a>  stood at the head of
             
            <a href="en3" id="en3.ref" class="footnote">Chestnut Street</a> , looking about him with the pleased air of a man of taste who
            does not very often get to Boston. He had lived there as a student, but for
            twenty years and more, since he had been Professor of Philosophy in a Western
            university, he had seldom come East except to take a steamer for some foreign
            port. Wilson was standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the
            slanting street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses,
            and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still shining. The
            gleam of the  
            <a href="en4" id="en4.ref" class="footnote">river</a>  at the foot of the hill made him blink a little, not so much
            because it was too bright as because he found it so pleasant. The few passers-by
            glanced at him unconcernedly, and even the children who hurried along with their
            school-bags under their arms seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown
            gentleman should be standing there, looking up through his glasses at
            the gray housetops. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs and the
            watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down the hill,
            descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow. His nostril, long
            unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood smoke in the air, blended
            with the odor of moist spring earth and the saltiness that came up the river
            with the tide. He crossed  
            <a href="en5" id="en5.ref" class="footnote">Charles Street</a>  between jangling street cars and
            shelving lumber drays, and after a moment of uncertainty wound into  
            <a href="en6" id="en6.ref" class="footnote">Brimmer
               Street
            </a> . The street was quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had
            already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his
            objective point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite
            direction. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have slackened
            his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal, appreciative glance.
            She was a person of distinction he saw at once, and, moreover, very handsome.
            She was tall, carried her beautiful head proudly, and moved with ease and
            certainty. One immediately took for granted the costly privileges and fine
            spaces that must lie in the background from which such a figure could emerge with
            this rapid and elegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,—for, in
            his way, he had an eye for such things,— particularly her brown furs
            and her hat. He got a blurred impression of her fine color, the  
            <a href="en7" id="en7.ref" class="footnote">violets</a>  she
            wore, her white gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a
            flight of steps in front of him and disappeared. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as completely
            and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long anticipated, and
            definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For a few pleasurable seconds
            he quite forgot where he was going, and only after the door had closed behind
            her did he realize that the young woman had entered the house to which he had
            directed his trunk from the  
            <a href="en8" id="en8.ref" class="footnote">South Station</a>  that morning. He hesitated a moment
            before mounting the steps. "Can that," he murmured in amazement,— "can
            that possibly have been  
            <a href="en9" id="en9.ref" class="footnote">Mrs. Alexander</a> ?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>When the servant admitted him, Mrs. Alexander was still standing in the hallway.
            She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her hand. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Is it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get here before
            I did. I was detained at a concert, and  
            <a href="en10" id="en10.ref" class="footnote">Bartley</a>  telephoned that he would be
            late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather have your tea brought to you
            there, or will you have it down here with me, while we
            wait for Bartley?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid walk, and with
            her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He followed her through the
            drawing-room into the library, where the wide back windows looked out upon the
            garden and the sunset and a fine stretch of silver-colored river. A harp-shaped
            elm stood stripped against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year's
            birds' nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star
            quivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a rich and
            amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed in front of the
            wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed chair and began to pour it,
            while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite her and took his cup with a great
            sense of ease and harmony and comfort. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"You have had a long journey, have n't you?" Mrs. Alexander asked, after showing
            gracious concern about his tea. "And I am so sorry Bartley is late. He's often
            tired when he's late. He flatters himself that it is a little on his
            account that you have come to this  
            <a href="en11" id="en11.ref" class="footnote">Congress of Psychologists</a> ." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"It is," Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; "and I hope he won't be
            tired to-night. But, on my own account, I'm glad
            to have a few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid
            that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to know you." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"That's very nice of you." She nodded at him above her cup and smiled, but there
            was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been there when she
            greeted him in the hall. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson leaned forward. "Have I said something awkward? I live very far out of the
            world, you know. But I did n't mean that you would exactly fade dim, even if
            Bartley 
            <em>were</em> here." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. "Oh, I'm not so vain! How terribly discerning
            you are." 
         </p>
         
         <p>She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank glance brought
            about an understanding between them. 
         </p>
         
         <p>He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly liked her
            eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were like a glimpse of
            fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Since you noticed something," Mrs. Alexander went on, "it must have been a
            flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of the
            people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they were talking of
            some one I had
            never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it would seem that he grew up among the
            strangest people. They usually say that he has turned out very well, or remark
            that he always was a fine fellow. I never know what reply to make." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot gently. "I
            expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well, Mrs. Alexander. Though
            I will say for myself that I was always confident he'd do something
            extraordinary." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Alexander's shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of impatience. "Oh,
            I should think that might have been a safe prediction. Another cup, please?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as you might
            imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose their courage; and
            some never get a fair wind. Bartley"—he dropped his chin on the back
            of his long hand and looked at her admiringly—"Bartley caught the wind
            early, and it has sung in his sails ever since." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and Wilson
            studied her half-averted face. He liked the suggestion of stormy possibilities
            in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that, he reflected,
            she would be too cold. "I should like to know what he was really like when he was
            a boy. I don't believe
            he remembers," she said suddenly. "Won't you smoke, Mr. Wilson?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson lit a cigarette. "No, I don't suppose he does. He was never introspective.
            He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known. We did n't
            know exactly what to do with him." 
         </p>
         
         <p>A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander screened
            her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw wavering bright spots
            on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Of course," she said, "I now and again hear stories about things that happened
            when he was in college." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"But that is n't what you want." Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at her with
            the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. "What you want is a
            picture of him, standing back there at the other end of twenty years. You want
            to look down through my memory." 
         </p>
         
         <p>She dropped her hands in her lap. "Yes, yes; that's exactly what I want." </p>
         
         <p>At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson laughed as
            Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. "There he is. Away with perspective! No past, no
            future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The only moment that ever was or will
            be in the world!" The door from the hall opened, a voice called "Winifred?" hurriedly,
            and a big
            man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread, bringing with him a
            smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air. When Alexander reached the
            library door, he switched on the lights and stood six feet and more in the
            archway, glowing with strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks.
            There were other bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always
            Alexander's picture that the  
            <a href="en12" id="en12.ref" class="footnote">Sunday Supplement men</a>  wanted, because he looked as
            a tamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his  
            <a href="en13" id="en13.ref" class="footnote">head seemed as
               hard and powerful as a catapult
            </a> , and his shoulders looked strong enough in
            themselves to support a span of any one of his ten great bridges that cut the
            air above as many rivers. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room over the
            library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of white lights along
            the  
            <a href="en14" id="en14.ref" class="footnote">Cambridge Embankment</a> . The room was not at all what one might expect of an
            engineer's study. Wilson felt at once the harmony of beautiful things that have
            lived long together without obtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of
            Alexander's doing, of course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and
            mellowing before he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place
            there,—that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for
            his vigor and vehemence. He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in the
            cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled above his
            broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth hand, a
            flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and
            exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"You are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells me." </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, for a few weeks only. There's a meeting of British engineers, and I'm doing
            another bridge in Canada, you know." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Oh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your wife, was
            n't it?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, at  
            <a href="en15" id="en15.ref" class="footnote">Allway</a> . She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most remarkable old
            lady. I was working with  
            <a href="en16" id="en16.ref" class="footnote">MacKeller</a>  then, an old Scotch engineer who had picked
            me up in London and taken me back to Quebec with him. He had the contract for
            the Allway Bridge, but before he began work on it he found out that he was going
            to die, and he advised the committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I'd
            never have got anything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of  
            <a href="en17" id="en17.ref" class="footnote">Mrs.
               Pemberton
            </a> , Winifred's aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway she asked
            me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Like her niece?" Wilson queried. </p>
         
         <p>Bartley laughed. "She had been very handsome, but not in Winifred's way. When I
            knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white, with a splendid head
            and a face like fine old lace, somehow,—but perhaps I always think of
            that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair. She had such a flavor
            of life about her. She had known  
            <a href="en18" id="en18.ref" class="footnote">Gordon</a>  and  
            <a href="en19" id="en19.ref" class="footnote">Livingstone</a>  and 
             
            <a href="en20" id="en20.ref" class="footnote">Beaconsfield</a>  when
            she was young,—every one. She was the first woman of that sort I'd
            ever known. You know how it is in the West,—old people are poked out
            of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done. I used
            to go up from the works to have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It
            was very stimulating, for she could n't tolerate stupidity." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"It must have been then that your luck began, Bartley," said Wilson,
            flicking his cigar ash with his long finger. "It's curious, watching
            boys," he went on reflectively. "I'm sure I did you justice in the
            matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot where
            some day strain would tell.  
            <a href="en21" id="en21.ref" class="footnote">Even after you began to climb, I stood down in the
               crowd and watched you with—well, not with confidence
            </a> . The more dazzling the front you
            presented, the higher your façade rose, the more I expected to see  
            <a href="en22" id="en22.ref" class="footnote">a
               big crack zigzagging from top to bottom
            </a> ,"—he indicated its course in
            the air with his forefinger,—"then a crash and clouds of dust. It was
            curious. I had such a clear picture of it. And another curious thing, Bartley,"
            Wilson spoke with deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, "is that I
            don't feel it any longer. I am sure of you." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander laughed. "Nonsense! It's not I you feel sure of; it's Winifred. People
            often make that mistake." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"No, I'm serious, Alexander. You've changed. You have decided to leave some birds
            in the bushes. You used to want them all." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander's chair creaked. "I still want a good many," he said rather gloomily.
            "After all, life does n't offer a man much. You work like the devil and think
            you're getting on, and suddenly you discover that you've only been  
            <a href="en23" id="en23.ref" class="footnote">getting
               yourself tied up
            </a> . A million details drink you dry. Your life keeps going for
            things you don't want, and all the while you are being built alive into a social
            structure you don't care a rap about. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I'd
            have been if I had n'tbeen this sort;  
            <a href="en24" id="en24.ref" class="footnote">I want to go and live out his
               potentialities, too
            </a> . I have n't forgotten that there are birds in the bushes." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust forward as
            if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him, wondering. His old
            pupil always stimulated him at first, and then vastly wearied him. The machinery
            was always pounding away in this man, and Wilson preferred companions of a more
            reflective habit of mind. He could not help feeling that there were
            unreasoning and unreasonable activities going on in Alexander all the while;
            that even after dinner, when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley
            had merely closed the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The
            machinery itself was still pounding on. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley's abstraction and Wilson's reflections were cut short by a
            rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander was
            standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she shook her
            head. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"No, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor Wilson were
            quite comfortable. I am going down to the music-room." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are tired of
            talk."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander," Wilson began, but he got no further.</p>
         
         <p>"Why, certainly, if you won't find me too noisy. I am working on  
            <a href="en25" id="en25.ref" class="footnote">the Schumann
               'Carnival,'
            </a>  and, though I don't practice a great many hours, I am very
            methodical," Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an upright piano that
            stood at the back of the room, near the windows. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair behind her.
            She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling. Wilson could not imagine
            her permitting herself to do anything badly, but he was surprised at the
            cleanness of her execution. He wondered how a woman with so many duties had
            managed to keep herself up to a standard really professional. It must take a
            great deal of time, certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time.
            Wilson reflected that he had never before known a woman who had been
            able, for any considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual
            passion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration, shading
            his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even younger than in
            street clothes, and, for all her composure and self-sufficiency, she seemed to
            him strangely alert and vibrating, as if in her, too, there were something never
            altogether at rest. He felt that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people
            and what she demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten
            years she must know him;
            and however one took him, however much one admired him, one had to admit that he
            simply would n't square. He was a natural force, certainly, but beyond that,
            Wilson felt, he was not anything very really or for very long at a time. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley's profile was still wreathed in
            cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His shoulders were sunk deep in
            the cushions and one hand hung large and passive over the arm of his chair. He
            had slipped on a  
            <a href="en26" id="en26.ref" class="footnote">purple velvet smoking-coat</a> . His wife, Wilson surmised, had
            chosen it. She was clearly very proud of his good looks and his fine color. But,
            with the glow of an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer's face
            looked tired, even a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly
            above the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped
            forward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson thought that
            beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling weariness of on-coming middle
            age. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden under the
            declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs. Alexander at the tea-table
            in the library. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Well," he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself, "there was
            a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley at his club, more
            psychologists, and here I am. I've looked forward to this hour all day." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. "And do you
            remember where we stopped yesterday?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Perfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I have color
            enough in me. Bartley makes me feel a faded  
            <a href="en27" id="en27.ref" class="footnote">monochrome</a> . You can't get at the
            young Bartley except by means of color." Wilson paused and deliberated. Suddenly
            he broke out: "He was n't a remarkable student, you know, though he was always
            strong in higher mathematics. His work in my own department was quite ordinary.
            It was as a powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the
            most interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a
            scientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing qualities so
            much oftener than we find force." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"And, after all," said Mrs. Alexander, "that is the thing we all live upon. It is
            the thing that takes us forward." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. "Exactly," he assented warmly. "It builds
            the bridges into the future, over which the
            feet of every one of us will go." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"How interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into the
            future—I often say that to myself. Bartley's bridges always seem to me
            like that. Have you ever seen  
            <a href="en28" id="en28.ref" class="footnote">his first suspension bridge in Canada</a> , the one he
            was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it sometime. We were
            married as soon as it was finished, and you will laugh when I tell you that it
            always has a rather bridal look to me. It is over the wildest river, with mists
            and clouds always battling about it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging
            in the sky. It really was a bridge into the future. You have only to look at it
            to feel that it meant the beginning of a great career. But I have a photograph
            of it here." She drew a  
            <a href="en29" id="en29.ref" class="footnote">portfolio</a>  from behind a bookcase. "And there, you see,
            on the hill, is my aunt's house." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Wilson took up the photograph. "Bartley was telling me something about your aunt
            last night. She must have been a delightful person." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Winifred laughed. "The bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the hill, and the
            noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But after she met Bartley
            she pretended to like it, and said it was a good thing to be reminded that there
            were things going on in the world. She loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal
            of it in to her when he came to
            the house. Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank, Early-Victorian manner. She
            liked men of action, and disliked young men who were careful of themselves and
            who, as she put it, were always  
            <a href="en30" id="en30.ref" class="footnote">trimming their wick</a>  as if they were afraid of
            their oil's giving out. MacKeller, Bartley's first chief, was an old friend of
            my aunt, and he told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which
            really pleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk after
            Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt Eleanor had found
            him much to her taste, but she had n't said anything. Presently she came out,
            with a chuckle: 'MacKeller found him sowing wild oats in London, I believe. I
            hope he did n't stop him too soon. Life coquets with dashing fellows. The coming
            men are always like that. We must have him to dinner, my dear.' And we did. She
            grew much fonder of Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna,
            and she thought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics, and
            she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used to declare
            that the  
            <a href="en31" id="en31.ref" class="footnote">Prince Consort</a>  had  
            <a href="en32" id="en32.ref" class="footnote">brought all that stuff over out of Germany</a> . She
            always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him. She considered that a
            newfangled way of making a match of it."
         </p>
         
         <p>When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his wife still
            confronting the photograph. "Oh, let us get that out of the way," he said,
            laughing. "Winifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down. I've decided to go over to
            New York to-morrow night and take a fast boat. I shall save two days."

      <h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
      
      <p>O
         <span class="smallcaps">N</span> the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to
         the  
         <a href="en33" id="en33.ref" class="footnote">hotel on the Embankment</a>  at which he always stopped, and in the lobby he was
         accosted by an old acquaintance,  
         <a href="en34" id="en34.ref" class="footnote">Maurice Mainhall</a> , who fell upon him with
         effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to dine with him. Bartley never
         dined alone if he could help it, and Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew
         what had been going on in town; especially, he knew everything that was not
         printed in the newspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian
         novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London
         and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them. He had
         written a number of books himself; among them a "History of Dancing," a "History
         of Costume," a "Key to Shakespeare's Sonnets," a study of  
         <a href="en35" id="en35.ref" class="footnote">"The Poetry of Ernest
            Dowson,"
         </a>  etc. Although Mainhall's enthusiasm was often tiresome, and although he
         was often unable to distinguish between facts and vivid figments of his
         imagination, his imperturbable good nature overcame even the people whom he bored
         most, so that they ended by becoming, in a reluctant
         manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the
         conventional stage-Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high,
         hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.
         He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face
         sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.
         Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had preconceived ideas
         about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers
         or mechanics. He hated them when they presumed to be anything else. 
      </p>
      
      <p>While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes of his old
         friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed that they should go to
         see  
         <a href="en36" id="en36.ref" class="footnote">Hugh MacConnell</a> 's new comedy,  
         <a href="en37" id="en37.ref" class="footnote">"Bog Lights."</a> 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>"It's really quite the best thing MacConnell's done," he explained as they got
         into a  
         <a href="en38" id="en38.ref" class="footnote">hansom</a> . "It's tremendously well put on, too. Florence Merrill and Cyril
         Henderson. But  
         <a href="en39" id="en39.ref" class="footnote">Hilda Burgoyne</a> 's the hit of the piece. Hugh's written a
         delightful part for her, and she's quite inexpressible. It's been on only two
         weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell's
         box for to-night or there'd be no chance of our getting places. There's everything
         in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
         She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time. The ones who have any imagination
         do." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Hilda Burgoyne!" Alexander exclaimed mildly. "Why, I have n't heard of her
         for—years." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Mainhall laughed. "Then you can't have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It's
         only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come
         up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in
         London—but what can one expect? Do you know,
         Alexander,"—Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the
         hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,—"do you know,
         I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be
         a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Just then they drove up to  
         <a href="en40" id="en40.ref" class="footnote">the Duke of York's</a> , so Alexander did not commit
         himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre. When they entered the
         stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the
         interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they sat down, a burst of
         applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage. Miss Burgoyne and her donkey
         were thrusting their heads in at the half door. "After all," he
         reflected, "there's small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless has n't
         thought of me for years." He felt the
         enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the
         current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy. The audience had come forewarned,
         evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey-girl ran upon the stage
         there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and
         Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"You see," he murmured in Alexander's ear, as the curtain fell on the first act,
         "one almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness.
         Of course, Hilda is Irish,—the Burgoynes have been stage people for
         generations,—and she has the Irish voice. It's delightful to hear it
         in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the
         hips—who ever heard it out of  
         <a href="en41" id="en41.ref" class="footnote">Galway</a> ? She saves her hand, too. She's
         at her best in the second act. She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see;
         makes the whole thing a fairy tale." 
      </p>
      
      <p>The second act opened before Philly Doyle's underground still, with Peggy and her
         battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of  
         <a href="en42" id="en42.ref" class="footnote">potheen</a>  across the bog, and to
         bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was
         happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather. Alexander,
         annoyed by Mainhall's
         sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest. As
         Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended
         upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft
         fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful
         brown eyes. When she began to dance, by way of showing the  
         <a href="en43" id="en43.ref" class="footnote">gossoons</a>  what she had
         seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar. After
         her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the  
         <a href="en44" id="en44.ref" class="footnote">ditch wall</a>  back of
         Philly's  
         <a href="en45" id="en45.ref" class="footnote">burrow</a> , where she sat singing  
         <a href="en46" id="en46.ref" class="footnote">"The Rising of the Moon"</a>  and making a
         wreath of primroses for her donkey. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the corridor. They
         met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he
         babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
         Presently he hailed a tall, bearded man, grim-browed and rather
         battered-looking, who had his opera cloak on his arm and his hat in his hand,
         and who seemed to be on the point of leaving the theatre. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"MacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It's going famously
         to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You'll never do anything like this again, mark
         me. A man writes
         to the top of his bent only once." 
      </p>
      
      <p>The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded eyes and
         made a wry face. "And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"That's what I was saying," Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a
         tone even more conspicuously confidential. "And you'll never bring Hilda out
         like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl could n't possibly be better, you know." 
      </p>
      
      <p>MacConnell grunted. "She'll do well enough if she keeps her pace and does n't go
         off on us in the middle of the season, as she's more than like to do." 
      </p>
      
      <p>He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went. </p>
      
      <p>"Poor old Hugh," Mainhall murmured. "He's hit terribly hard. He's been wanting to
         marry Hilda these three years and more. She does n't take up with anybody, you
         know.  
         <a href="en47" id="en47.ref" class="footnote">Irene Burgoyne</a> , one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a
         romance somewhere back in the beginning. One of your countrymen, Alexander, by
         the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe. I dare say it's
         quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy
         with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid
         excitement was tingling through him. Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added
         in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite
         capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that. Here comes Sir Harry
         Towne. He's another who's awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir
         Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his wife in
         Tokyo. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Mainhall cut in impatiently. </p>
      
      <p>"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously tonight, is n't she?" </p>
      
      <p>Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously. "Do you know, I thought the dance a bit
         conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy,
         poor child. Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she
         seemed quite uncertain of herself. A little attack of nerves, possibly." 
      </p>
      
      <p>He bowed as the  
         <a href="en48" id="en48.ref" class="footnote">warning bell</a>  rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord
         Westmere, of course,— the stooped man with the long gray mustache,
         talking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda." 
      </p>
      
      <p>When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing  
         <a href="en49" id="en49.ref" class="footnote">"The Cloak of Old Gaul</a> ." In a moment Peggy
         was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest. He
         even leaned forward over the rail a little. For some reason he felt pleased and
         flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience. In the half-light he
         looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling
         with amusement Sir Harry's judicial frown. He was beginning to feel a keen
         interest in the slender, barefoot  
         <a href="en50" id="en50.ref" class="footnote">donkey-girl</a>  who slipped in and out of the
         play, singing, like some one winding through a hilly field. He leaned forward
         and beamed felicitations as warmly as Mainhall himself when, at the end of the
         play, she came again and again before the curtain, panting a little and
         flushed, her eyes dancing and her eager, nervous little mouth
         tremulous with excitement. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When Alexander returned to his hotel—he shook Mainhall at the door of
         the theatre—he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late
         before he went to bed. He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed,
         he had almost forgotten her. He had last written to her from Canada, after he
         first met Winifred, telling her that everything was changed with him—
         that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he could; if he could not, then
         all the more was everything changed for him. Hilda had never replied to his letter.
         He felt guilty and
         unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really
         forgot Hilda altogether. When he wrote her that everything was changed for him,
         he was telling the truth. After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself
         like a different man. One night when he and Winifred were sitting together on
         the bridge, he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad
         that he was sorry for,—one thing in particular,—and he asked
         her whether she thought she ought to know about them. She considered a moment
         and then said: "No, I think not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can't
         be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal
         things,"—here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a
         quick, impulsive gesture—"oh, about those I should be very jealous. I
         should torture myself—I could n't help it." After that it was easy to
         forget, actually to forget. He wondered to-night, as he poured his wine, how
         many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years. He had been in London
         more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her. "All the same," he
         lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda. You've made things come your
         way, and I never thought you'd do it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of
         something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft. But I never
         thought she'd do anything. She had n't much ambition then, and she was too fond
         of trifles. She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she
         used to. Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all. Sometimes a
         little jolt like that does one good. She was a daft, generous little thing. I'm
         glad she's held her own since. After all, we were awfully young. It was youth
         and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly. I should n't
         wonder if she could laugh about it with me now. I should n't
         wonder—But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if
         one met her again." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed. </p>

         <p>T
            <span class="smallcaps">HE</span> next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine
            o'clock he dropped in at the Duke of York's. The house was sold out and he stood
            through the second act. When he returned to his hotel he examined the new
            directory, and found Miss Burgoyne's address still given as off  
            <a href="en51" id="en51.ref" class="footnote">Bedford Square</a> ,
            though at a new number. He remembered that, in so far as she had been brought up
            at all, she had been brought up in  
            <a href="en52" id="en52.ref" class="footnote">Bloomsbury</a> . Her father and mother played in
            the provinces most of the year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an
            old aunt who was crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage
            altogether. In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed to have a
            lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung tenaciously to such
            scraps and shreds of memories as were connected with it.  
            <a href="en53" id="en53.ref" class="footnote">The mummy room of the
               British Museum
            </a>  had been one of the chief delights of her childhood. That
            forbidding pile was the goal of her truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken
            there for a treat, as other children are taken to the theatre. It was long since Alexander
            had thought of any of these things, but now
            they came back to him quite fresh, and had a significance they did not have when
            they were first told him in his restless twenties. So she was still in the old
            neighborhood, near Bedford Square. The new number probably meant increased
            prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was snugly settled. He
            looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she would not be home for a good
            two hours yet, and he might as well walk over and have a look at the place. He
            remembered the shortest way. 
         </p>
         
         <p>It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went through  
            <a href="en54" id="en54.ref" class="footnote">Covent
               Garden
            </a>  to  
            <a href="en55" id="en55.ref" class="footnote">Oxford Street</a> , and as he turned into Museum Street he walked more
            slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he approached the sullen gray mass at
            the end. He had not been inside the Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to
            meet there; sometimes to set out for gay adventures at  
            <a href="en56" id="en56.ref" class="footnote">Twickenham or Richmond</a> ,
            sometimes to linger about the place for a while and to ponder by  
            <a href="en57" id="en57.ref" class="footnote">Lord Elgin's
               marbles
            </a>  upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room, upon the
            awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought of the British
            Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things in the
            world were assembled to make one's hour of youth the more precious. One trembled lest
            before he got out it
            might somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness and
            see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet. How one hid his youth
            under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one's back upon all
            that vaulted cold, to take Hilda's arm and hurry out of the great door and down
            the steps into the sunlight among the pigeons— to know that the warm
            and vital thing within him was still there and had not been snatched away to
            flush  
            <a href="en58" id="en58.ref" class="footnote">Cæsar's lean cheek or to feed the veins of some

            <a href="en59" id="en59.ref" class="footnote">but to-day was his!</a>  So the song used to run in his head those summer
            mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked by the place very quietly, as if he
            were afraid of waking some one. 
         </p>
         
         <p>He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The house, a
            comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the four front windows
            on the second floor, where a low, even light was burning behind the
            white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were window boxes, painted white and
            full of flowers. Bartley was making a third round of the Square when
            he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a hansom-cab horse, driven
            rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was astonished to find that it was a few minutes
            after twelve. He turned and
            walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda's number and
            stopped. The hansom must have been one that she employed regularly, for she did
            not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out quickly and lightly. He heard her
            cheerful "Good-night, cabby," as she ran up the steps and opened the door with a
            latchkey. In a few moments the lights flared up brightly behind the
            white curtains, and as he walked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone
            too far to look up without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling
            that he had had a good evening, and he slept well. 
         </p>
         
         <p>For the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the office of a
            Scotch engineering firm on  
            <a href="en60" id="en60.ref" class="footnote">Henrietta Street</a> , and was at work almost constantly.
            He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at his hotel. One afternoon, after
            he had tea, he started for a walk down the Embankment toward  
            <a href="en61" id="en61.ref" class="footnote">Westminster,
               intending to end his stroll at Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne
               would let him take her to the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached
               the Abbey
            </a> , he turned back and crossed  
            <a href="en62" id="en62.ref" class="footnote">Westminster Bridge</a>  and sat down to watch
            the trails of smoke behind the  
            <a href="en63" id="en63.ref" class="footnote">Houses of Parliament</a>  catch fire with the sunset.
            The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little
            flickering flames;  
            <a href="en64" id="en64.ref" class="footnote">Somerset House</a>  and the bleached gray
            pinnacles about  
            <a href="en65" id="en65.ref" class="footnote">Whitehall</a> were floated in a luminous haze. The yellow
            light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires.
            There was a smell of  
            <a href="en66" id="en66.ref" class="footnote">acacias</a>  in the air everywhere, and the  
            <a href="en67" id="en67.ref" class="footnote">laburnums</a>  were
            dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It was a sweet, lonely kind of
            summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she used to be, was doubtless more
            satisfactory than seeing her as she must be now— and, after all,
            Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own young years that he was
            remembering? 
         </p>
         
         <p>He crossed back to Westminster, went up to  
            <a href="en68" id="en68.ref" class="footnote">the Temple, and sat down to smoke in
               the Middle Temple gardens
            </a> , listening to the thin voice of the fountain and
            smelling the spice of the  
            <a href="en69" id="en69.ref" class="footnote">sycamores</a>  that came out heavily in the damp evening
            air. He thought, as he sat there, about a great many things: about his own youth
            and Hilda's; above all, he thought of how glorious it had been, and how quickly
            it had passed; and, when it had passed, how little worth while anything was.
            None of the things he had gained in the least compensated. In the last six years
            his reputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had been
            called to  
            <a href="en70" id="en70.ref" class="footnote">Japan to deliver, at the Emperor's request, a course of lectures at the Imperial University</a> , and had instituted reforms throughout the
            islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but in drainage and
            road-making. On his return he had undertaken the bridge at Moor-lock, in Canada,
            the most important piece of bridge-building going on in the world,— 
            <a href="en71" id="en71.ref" class="footnote">a
               test, indeed, of how far the latest practice in bridge structure could be
               carried
            </a> . It was a spectacular undertaking by reason of its very size, and
            Bartley realized that, whatever else he might do, he would probably always be
            known as the engineer who designed the great  
            <a href="en72" id="en72.ref" class="footnote">Moorlock Bridge, the longest
               cantilever in existence
            </a> . Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had
            ever done. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was using
            lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had vexations enough,
            too, with his work at home. He had several bridges under way in the United
            States, and they were always being held up by strikes and delays resulting from
            a general industrial unrest. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work than he
            had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had never got so little
            out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the demands made on his time by
            boards of civic enterprise and committees of public welfare. The obligations
            imposed by his wife's fortune and position were sometimes distracting to a man who
            followed his profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many
            worthy endeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was
            becoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that success
            would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only power that was in
            itself another kind of restraint. He had always meant to keep his personal
            liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first chief, had done, and not, like
            so many American engineers, to become a part of a professional movement, a
            cautious board member,  
            <a href="en73" id="en73.ref" class="footnote">a Nestor 
               <em>de pontibus.</em>
               
            </a>  He happened to be engaged in
            work of public utility, but he was not willing to become what is called a public
            man. He found himself living exactly the kind of life he had determined to
            escape. What, he asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and
            substantial comforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly;
            overwork had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which
            confronted him,—of that he was afraid. He was not ready for it. It was
            like being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a thing
            possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to be free; and
            there was still something unconquered in him, something besides the strong
            workhorse that his profession had made of him. He felt rich to-night in the
            possession of that unstultified survival; in the light of his experience, it was
            more precious than honors or achievement. In all those busy, successful years
            there had been nothing so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness. This
            feeling was the only happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the
            only ones in which he could feel his own continuous identity—feel the
            boy he had been in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked
            his way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris without a
            dollar in his pocket. The man who sat in his offices in Boston was only a
            powerful machine. Under the activities of that machine the person who, at such
            moments as this, he felt to be himself, was fading and dying. He remembered how,
            when he was a little boy and his father called him in the morning, he used to
            leap from his bed into the full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was
            Life itself. Whatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of
            concentrated thought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society;
            things that could be bought in the market. There was only one thing that had an
            absolute value for each individual, and it was just that  
            <a href="en74" id="en74.ref" class="footnote">original impulse</a> , that internal heat, that feeling of one's self in one's own breast. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were blinking
            along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars were shining in
            the wide sky above the river. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish performance.
            It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find, and he got no farther
            than the Temple gardens and the Embankment. It was a pleasant kind of
            loneliness. To a man who was so little given to reflection, whose
            dreams always took the form of definite ideas, reaching into the future, there
            was a seductive excitement in renewing old experiences in imagination. He
            started out upon these walks half guiltily, with a curious longing and
            expectancy which were wholly gratified by solitude. Solitude, but not
            solitariness; for he walked shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy
            companion—not little Hilda Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly
            dearer to him than she had ever been—his own young self, the youth who
            had waited for him upon the steps of the British Museum that night, and who,
            though he had tried to pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked
            an arm in his. 
         </p>
         
         <p>It was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him this youth
            was the most dangerous of companions. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>One Sunday evening, at Lady Walford's, Alexander did at last meet Hilda Burgoyne.
            Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there. He looked about for her
            rather nervously, and finally found her at the farther end of the large
            drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men, young and old. She was apparently
            telling them a story. They were all laughing and bending toward her. When she
            saw Alexander, she rose quickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a
            little to let him approach. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Mr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?" </p>
         
         <p>Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. "Long enough to have seen you
            more than once. How fine it all is!" 
         </p>
         
         <p>She laughed as if she were pleased. "I'm glad you think so. I like it. Won't you
            join us here?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Miss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway last
            summer," Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again. Lord Westmere
            stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand and looked at Alexander blankly.
            Hilda was a good story-teller. She was
            sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a moment
            only. Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her slender, supple
            figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish skin and brown hair.
            Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her active, girlish body with its
            slender hips and quick, eager shoulders. Alexander heard little of the story,
            but he watched Hilda intently. She must certainly, he reflected, be
            thirty, and he was honestly delighted to see that the years had treated her so
            indulgently. If her face had changed at all, it was in a slight hardening of the
            mouth—still eager enough to be very disconcerting at times, he
            felt—and in an added air of self-possession and self-reliance. She
            carried her head, too, a little more resolutely. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to Alexander, and the
            other men drifted away. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I thought I saw you in MacConnell's box with Mainhall one evening, but I
            supposed you had left town before this." 
         </p>
         
         <p>She looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an old
            friend whom she was glad to meet again. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
             
            <a href="en75" id="en75.ref" class="footnote">"No, I've been mooning about here</a> ." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda laughed gayly. "Mooning! I see you mooning! You must be the busiest man in
            the world. Time and success have done well by you, you know. You're handsomer
            than ever and you've gained a grand manner." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander blushed and bowed. "Time and success have been good friends to both of
            us. Are n't you tremendously pleased with yourself ?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>She laughed again and shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, so-so. But I want to hear
            about you. Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about the wonderful
            things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated you. What was it,
             
            <a href="en76" id="en76.ref" class="footnote">Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun</a> ? That sounds like  
            <a href="en77" id="en77.ref" class="footnote">'The Mikado.'</a>  And
            what about your new bridge—in Canada, is n't it, and it's to be the
            longest one in the world and has some queer name I can't remember." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley shook his head and smiled drolly. "Since when have you been interested in
            bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in everything? And is that a part
            of success?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!" Hilda exclaimed. </p>
         
         <p>"Well, I think we won't talk about bridges here, at any rate." Bartley looked
            down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug impatiently
            under the hem of her gown. "But I wonder whether you'd think me impertinent if I asked
            you
            to let me come to see you sometime and tell you about them?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons." </p>
         
         <p>"I know. Mainhall offered to take me. But you must know that I've been in London
            several times within the last few years, and you might very well think that just
            now is a rather inopportune time—" 
         </p>
         
         <p>She cut him short. "Nonsense. One of the pleasantest things about success is
            that it makes people want to look one up, if that's what you mean. I'm like
            every one else—more agreeable to meet when things are going well with
            me. Don't you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do something that people
            like?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Does it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I did n't want
            you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you." He spoke very
            seriously and looked down at the floor. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then broke into a
            low, amused laugh. "My dear Mr. Alexander, you have strange delicacies. If you
            please, that is exactly why you wish to see me. We understand that, do we not?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger
            about awkwardly. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her shrewd eyes.
            "Come, don't be angry, but don't try to pose for me, or to be anything but what
            you are. If you care to come, it's yourself I'll be glad to see, and you
            thinking well of yourself. Don't try to wear a cloak of humility; it does n't
            become you. Stalk in as you are and don't make excuses. I'm not accustomed to
            inquiring into the motives of my guests. That would hardly be safe, even for
            Lady Walford, in a great house like this." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Sunday afternoon, then," said Alexander, as she rose to join her hostess. "How
            early may I come?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I'm at home after four, and I'll be glad to see you, Bartley." </p>
         
         <p>She gave him her hand and flushed and laughed. He bent over it a little
            stiffly. She went away on Lady Walford's arm, and as he stood
            watching her yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather
            sullen. He felt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly.

      <h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>
      
      <p>O
         <span class="smallcaps">N</span> Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation
         and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he met
         charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and
         competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea. Alexander
         arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in during the course of the
         afternoon. Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his
         teacup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deepset, faded eyes. He
         seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a
         robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing
         his freshly creased clothes apprehensively. It was not very long, indeed, before
         his coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his hair and
         beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale. His dry humor went under a
         cloud of absentminded kindliness which, Mainhall explained, always overtook him
         here. He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he
         behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young
         girl's party. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and  
         <a href="en78" id="en78.ref" class="footnote">Lady Kildare, the Irish
            philanthropist
         </a> , brought her young nephew,  
         <a href="en79" id="en79.ref" class="footnote">Robert Owen</a> , who had come up from
         Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to
         Miss Burgoyne. Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair,
         flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about
         nervously over his high collar. Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her
         husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly  
         <a href="en80" id="en80.ref" class="footnote">deranged
            upon the subject of the fourth dimension
         </a> . On other matters he was perfectly
         rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation. He looked very much like
          
         <a href="en81" id="en81.ref" class="footnote">Agassiz</a> , and his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and
         tight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of  
         <a href="en82" id="en82.ref" class="footnote">Mrs. Browning</a> . Hilda
         seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so
         pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they
         did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their
         'bus. They asked him to come to see them in  
         <a href="en83" id="en83.ref" class="footnote">Chelsea</a> , and they spoke very
         tenderly of Hilda. "She's a dear, unworldly little thing," said the philosopher absently;
         "more like the stage people of my young days—folk
         of simple manners. There are n't many such left. American tours have spoiled
         them, I'm afraid. They have all grown very smart.  
         <a href="en84" id="en84.ref" class="footnote">Lamb</a>  would n't care a great
         deal about many of them, I fancy." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon. He had a long
         talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a
         discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he was nervous and
         unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate
         departure. On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a
         hansom, and drove to Bedford Square. He sent up his card, but it came back to
         him with a message scribbled across the front.

      </p>
      
      <p>When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty
         little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs. Hilda was
         writing in her living-room, under the light of a tall desk lamp. Bartley
         recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady
         Walford's. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'm so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know," he said,
         taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her  
         <a href="en85" id="en85.ref" class="footnote">canary
            slippers
         </a>  to her smoothly parted brown hair. "Yes, it's very, very pretty. Every
         one at Lady Walford's was looking at it." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda curtsied. "Is that why you think it pretty? I've no need for fine clothes
         in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few  
         <a href="en86" id="en86.ref" class="footnote">duddies</a>  for myself. It's owing to
         that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner. I don't need
         Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway
         girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been
         here, for I remember you don't like English cookery." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything. </p>
      
      <p>"I have n't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this
         is. Where did you get those etchings? They're quite unusual, are n't they?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very much
         interested in the American artist who did them. They are all sketches made about
         the  
         <a href="en87" id="en87.ref" class="footnote">Villa d'Este</a> , you see. He painted that  
         <a href="en88" id="en88.ref" class="footnote">group of cypresses</a>  for  
         <a href="en89" id="en89.ref" class="footnote">the Salon</a> , and
         it was bought for  
         <a href="en90" id="en90.ref" class="footnote">the Luxembourg</a> ." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander walked over to the bookcases. "It's the air of the whole place here
         that I like. You have n't got anything that does n't belong. Seems to me it
         looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many flowers. I like
         these little yellow irises." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Rooms always look better by lamplight—in London, at least. Though
         Marie is clean—really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the
         flowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden
         market yesterday morning." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'm glad," said Alexander simply. "I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so
         pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about
         you. You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade
         elephant from her desk. "Those fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They
         don't talk of any one else as they do of you." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the
         bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It's not worth much, but I
         love it. I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my
         three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons. He's
         that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than
         other fellows ever get. And I've traveled a bit, too." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served. </p>
      
      <p>"My dining-room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you
         have ever seen." 
      </p>
      
      <p>It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf
         full of china. Hilda saw Alexander look up at it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's. Heaven
         knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what
         baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it has n't been stowed away. We always
         had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the
         queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre— queer
         theatres, for that matter." 
      </p>
      
      <p>It was a wonderful little dinner. There was watercress soup, and sole, and a
         delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small
         rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had
         always been very fond. He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was
         still no other he liked so well. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I have some champagne for you, too. I don't drink it myself, but I like to see
         it behave when it's poured. There is nothing else that looks so jolly." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Thank you. But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine
         against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about. "You
         have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris much these late years?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully. "Oh, yes, I go over to Paris
         often. There are few changes in  
         <a href="en91" id="en91.ref" class="footnote">the old Quarter</a> . Dear old Madame Anger is
         dead—but perhaps you don't remember her?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Don't I, though! I'm so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I remember
         how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed till ten o'clock.
         He was the laziest fellow at  
         <a href="en92" id="en92.ref" class="footnote">the Beaux Arts</a> ; and that's saying a good deal." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect when he will
         work. He's a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever. But
         Angel—do you remember Angel?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Perfectly. Did she ever get back to  
         <a href="en93" id="en93.ref" class="footnote">Brittany</a>  and her  
         <a href="en94" id="en94.ref" class="footnote">
            
            <em>bains de mer?</em>
            
         </a> " 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Ah, no. Poor Angel! She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers in Madame
         Anger's little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and then with another
         soldier. Too bad! She still lives about the Quarter, and, though there is always
         a  
         <a href="en95" id="en95.ref" class="footnote">
            
            <em>soldat,</em>
            
         </a>  she has become a  
         <a href="en96" id="en96.ref" class="footnote">
            
            <em>blanchisseuse de fin.</em>
            
         </a>  She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was
         there, and was so delighted to see me again. I gave her all my old clothes, even
         my old hats, though she always wears her  
         <a href="en97" id="en97.ref" class="footnote">Breton headdress</a> . Her hair is still
         like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the
         same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her
         
         <em>bains de mer.</em>" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a
         low, happy laugh. "How jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you remember that
         first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down to the  
         <a href="en98" id="en98.ref" class="footnote">Place Saint-Michel</a> 
         to buy some  
         <a href="en99" id="en99.ref" class="footnote">lilacs</a> . Do you remember how sweet they smelled?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Indeed I do. Come, we'll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke." </p>
      
      <p>Hilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk, but
         Bartley found it pleasant to continue it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"What a warm, soft spring evening that was," he went on, as they sat down in the
         study with the coffee on a little table between them; "and the sky, over the
         bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked on down by the river, did
         n't we?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly. He saw a gleam in her eyes that he
         remembered even better than the episode he was recalling. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I think we did," she answered demurely. "It was on  
         <a href="en100" id="en100.ref" class="footnote">the Quai</a>  we met that woman
         who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you
         gave her a franc. I was frightened at your prodigality." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I expect it was the last franc I had. What a strong brown face she had, and very
         tragic. She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black
         shawl. What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs,
         but just our youth. I remember it touched me so. I would have given her some of
         mine off my back, if I could. I had enough and to spare then," Bartley mused,
         and looked thoughtfully at his cigar. 
      </p>
      
      <p>They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God
         give you a happy love!" It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual
         beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating
         with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had
         the anguish of a voice of prophecy. Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized
         that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang
         out so sharply, had frightened them both. They went home sadly with the lilacs,
         back to the  
         <a href="en101" id="en101.ref" class="footnote">Rue Saint-Jacques</a> , walking very slowly, arm in arm. When they
         reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and
         up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had
         kissed her for the first time. He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he
         remembered, and she had trembled so— 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. "Dear me, why did you
         do that? I had quite forgotten—I was back there. It was very jolly,"
         he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda laughed and went over to the piano. "Well, we are neither of us twenty now,
         you know. Have I told you about my new play?  
         <a href="en102" id="en102.ref" class="footnote">Mac is writing one; really for me
            this time
         </a> . You see, I'm coming on." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I've seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear yellow gowns?
         I hope so." 
      </p>
      
      <p>He was looking at her round, slender figure, as she stood by the piano, turning
         over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"No, it is n't a dress-up part. He does n't seem to fancy me in fine feathers. He
         says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose I ought. But he's
         given me some good Irish songs. Listen." 
      </p>
      
      <p>She sat down at the piano and sang. When she finished, Alexander shook himself
         out of a reverie. "Sing  
         <a href="en103" id="en103.ref" class="footnote">'The Harp that Once,'</a>  Hilda. You used to sing it so
         well."
      </p>
      
      <p>"Nonsense. Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and
         grandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I
         tried a master; but he confused me, just!" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander laughed. "All the same, sing it, Hilda." </p>
      
      <p>Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. "It's
         really too warm in this room to sing. Don't you feel it?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander went over and opened the window for her. "Are n't you afraid to let the
         wind blow like that on your neck? Can't I get a scarf or something?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Ask a theatre lydy if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed. "But perhaps, as
         I'm so warm—give me your handkerchief. There, just in front." He
         slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps. "There, that will do.
         It looks like a bib." She pushed his hand away quickly and stood looking out
         into the deserted square. "Is n't London a tomb on Sunday night?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander caught the agitation in her voice. He stood a little behind her, and
         tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty. See how white the
         stars are." 
      </p>
      
      <p>For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke. They stood close together,
         looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more quickly and lightly,
         and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world had stopped. Suddenly he moved the
         clenched hand he held behind him and dropped it
         violently at his side. He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in
         front of him. 
      </p>
      
      <p>She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning
         round. "Here, take it. You must go now, Bartley. Good-night." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear:
         "You are giving me a chance?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Yes. Take it and go. This is n't fair, you know. Good-night." </p>
      
      <p>Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides. With one he threw down the
         window and with the other—still standing behind her—he drew
         her back against him. 
      </p>
      
      <p>She uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his face down to
         hers. "Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered.

      <h4>CHAPTER V</h4>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>I
            <span class="smallcaps">T</span> was the afternoon of the day before Christmas. Mrs. Alexander had
            been driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of her
            friends. She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she spoke to the
            butler: "Thomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see Norah. In half an
            hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar and put them in the library.
            Mr. Alexander will be home at three to hang them himself. Don't forget the
            stepladder, and plenty of tacks and string. You may bring the  
            <a href="en104" id="en104.ref" class="footnote">azaleas</a>  upstairs.
            Take the white one to Mr. Alexander's study. Put the two pink ones in this room,
            and the red one in the drawing-room." 
         </p>
         
         <p>A little before three o'clock Mrs. Alexander went into the library to see that
            everything was ready. She pulled the window shades high, for the weather was
            dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in the streets. A foot of snow
            had fallen during the morning, and the wide space over the river was thick with
            flying flakes that fell and wreathed the masses of
            floating ice. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Winifred was standing by the window when she heard the front door open. She
            hurried to the hall as Alexander came stamping in, covered with snow. He kissed
            her joyfully and brushed away the snow that fell on her hair. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me, Winifred.
             
            <a href="en105" id="en105.ref" class="footnote">The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the pond</a>  and are
            skating furiously. Did the  
            <a href="en106" id="en106.ref" class="footnote">cyclamens</a>  come?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"An hour ago. What splendid ones! But are n't you frightfully extravagant?" </p>
         
         <p>"Not for Christmas-time. I'll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall be down in
            a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready." 
         </p>
         
         <p>When Alexander reappeared, he took his wife's arm and went with her into the
            library. "When did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the white one in my
            room." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I told him to put it there." </p>
         
         <p>"But, I say, it's much the finest of the lot!" </p>
         
         <p>"That's why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room for a red
            one, you know." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley began to sort the greens. "It looks very splendid there, but I feel
            piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than anywhere else
            in the house. Will you hand me the  
            <a href="en107" id="en107.ref" class="footnote">holly</a> ?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>He climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began to twist
            the tough stems of the holly into the framework of the chandelier. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning, explaining
            his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in Vermont has
            conveniently died and left Wilson a little money—something like ten
            thousand. He's coming on to settle up the estate. Won't it be jolly to have
            him?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"And how fine that he's come into a little money. I can see him posting down
             
            <a href="en108" id="en108.ref" class="footnote">State Street</a>  to the steamship offices. He will get a good many trips out of that
            ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected him here for luncheon." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Those trains from Albany are always late. He'll be along sometime this
            afternoon. And now, don't you want to go upstairs and lie down for an hour?
            You've had a busy morning and I don't want you to be tired to-night." 
         </p>
         
         <p>After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the greens for a
            few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of string, he sighed suddenly
            and sat down, staring out of the window at the snow. The animation died out of
            his face, but in his eyes there was a restless light, a look of apprehension and
            suspense. He kept clasping and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to
            realize something. The clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the
            afternoon outside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he
            first sat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands
            between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself away from
            his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in which he sat, from
            everything except the wild eddies of snow above the river on which his eyes were
            fixed with feverish intentness, as if he were trying to project himself thither.
            When at last Lucius Wilson was announced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet
            and hurried to meet his old instructor. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Hello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot of people
            to dinner to-night, and Winifred's lying down. You will excuse her, won't you?
            And now what about yourself ? Sit down and tell me everything." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I think I'd rather move about, if you don't mind. I've been sitting in the train
            for a week, it seems to me." Wilson stood before the fire with his hands behind
            him and looked about the room. "You 
            <em>have</em> been busy. Bartley, if I'd had
            my choice of all possible places in which to spend Christmas, your house would
            certainly be the place I'd have chosen. Happy people do a great deal for their friends.
            A house
            like this throws its warmth out. I felt it distinctly as I was coming through
             
            <a href="en109" id="en109.ref" class="footnote">the Berkshires</a> . I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs. Bartley again so
            soon." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Thank you, Wilson. She'll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea now? I'll
            ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I always wreck the
            house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am quite tired. Looks as if I
            were not used to work, does n't it?" Alexander laughed and dropped into a chair.
            "You know, I'm sailing the day after New Year's." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Again? Why, you've been over twice since I was here in the spring, have n't
            you?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Oh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the hot weather
            more than anything else. I shan't be gone more than a month this time. Winifred
            and I have been up in Canada for most of the autumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on
            my back all the time. I never had so much trouble with a job before." Alexander
            moved about restlessly and fell to poking the fire. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Have n't I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about  
            <a href="en110" id="en110.ref" class="footnote">a tidewater
               bridge of yours in New Jersey
            </a> ?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Oh, that does n't amount to anything. It's held up by a steel strike. A bother,
            of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up with. But the
            Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety. You see, the truth is, we are having to
            build pretty well to the strain limit up there.  
            <a href="en111" id="en111.ref" class="footnote">They've crowded me too much on
               the cost
            </a> . It's all very well if everything goes well, but these estimates have
            never been used for anything of such length before. However, there's nothing to
            be done. They hold me to the scale I've used in shorter bridges. The last thing
            a bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build." 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>When Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study, where he
            found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"These pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings," she said, smiling, "and I am
            sure she meant them for you." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the wreaths in
            the windows. "Have you a moment, Winifred? I have just now been thinking that
            this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?" He went up to the table and
            took her hands away from the flowers, drying them with his pocket
            handkerchief. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"They've been awfully happy ones, all of them, have n't they?" He took her in his
            arms and bent back, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss. "You are
            happy, are n't you, Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you
            to be happy. Sometimes, of late, I've thought you looked as if you were
            troubled." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"No; it's only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried, Bartley. I
            wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don't, always." She looked
            earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and forth in
            his own, laughing his big blond laugh. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I'm growing older, my dear; that's what you feel. Now, may I show you something?
            I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear them to-night." He
            took a little leather box out of his pocket and opened it. On the white velvet
            lay two long pendants of curiously worked gold, set with pearls. Winifred looked
            from the box to Bartley and exclaimed:— 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Where did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?" </p>
         
         <p>"It's old Flemish. Is n't it fine?" </p>
         
         <p>"They are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear earrings."
            
         </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted you to. So few
            women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with,
            and a nose"—he waved his hand—"above reproach. Most women
            look silly in them. They go only with faces like yours—very, very
            proud, and just a little hard." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Winifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate springs
            to the lobes of her ears. "Oh, Bartley, that old foolishness about my being
            hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down now. People are beginning
            to come." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her. "Not hard to
            me, Winifred," he whispered. "Never, never hard to me." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Left alone, he paced up and down his study. He was at home again, among all the
            dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years. His house tonight
            would be full of charming people, who liked and admired him. Yet all the time,
            underneath his pleasure and hopefulness and satisfaction, he was conscious of
            the vibration of an unnatural excitement. Amid this light and warmth and
            friendliness, he sometimes started and shuddered,  
            <a href="en112" id="en112.ref" class="footnote">as if some one had stepped on
               his grave
            </a> . Something had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except
            that it was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him. Sometimes
            it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries. Sometimes it battered him like the
            cannon
            rolling in the hold of the vessel. Always, now, it brought with it a sense of
            quickened life, of stimulating danger. To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he
            was walking the floor, after his wife left him. It seemed impossible;
            he could not believe it. He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her
            back. He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down. Going
            over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river. How could this
            happen here, in his own house, among the things he loved? What was it that
            reached in out of the darkness and thrilled him? As he stood there he had a
            feeling that he would never escape. He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead
            against the cold window glass, breathing in the chill that came through it.
            "That this," he groaned, "that this should have happened to 
            <em>me!</em>" 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>On New Year's day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain fell. In
            the morning, the morning of Alexander's departure for England, the river was
            streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the windows of the
            breakfast-room. Alexander had finished his coffee and was pacing up and down.
            His wife sat at the table, watching him. She was pale and unnaturally calm. When Thomas
            brought the letters, Bartley sank into his chair and ran them
            over rapidly. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Here's a note from old Wilson. He's safe back at his grind, and says he had a
            bully time. 'The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole winter fragrant.'
            Just like him. He will go on getting measureless satisfaction out of you by his
            study fire. What a man he is for looking on at life!" Bartley sighed, pushed the
            letters back impatiently, and went over to the window. "This is a nasty sort of
            day to sail. I've a notion to call it off. Next week would be time enough." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"That would only mean starting twice. It would n't really help you out at all,"
            Mrs. Alexander spoke soothingly. "And you'd come back late for all your
            engagements." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket. "I wish things would let
            me rest. I'm tired of work, tired of people, tired of trailing about." He looked
            out at the storm-beaten river. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Winifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. "That's what you
            always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these things. Can't you
            remember that?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>He put his arm about her. "All the same, life runs smoothly enough with some
            people, and with me it's always a messy sort of patchwork. It's  
            <a href="en113" id="en113.ref" class="footnote">like the song; peace is where I am not</a> .
            How can you face it all with so much fortitude?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>She looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much admired, which he
            had felt implied such high confidence and fearless pride. "Oh, I faced that long
            ago, when you were on your first bridge, up at old Allway. I knew then that your
            paths were not to be  
            <a href="en114" id="en114.ref" class="footnote">paths of peace</a> , but I decided that I wanted to follow
            them." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in the
            grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy  
            <a href="en115" id="en115.ref" class="footnote">Angora</a>  looked
            up at them curiously. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Presently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door. "Shall Edward bring down your
            trunks, sir?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Yes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study
            table." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Thomas withdrew, closing the door softly. Bartley turned away from his wife,
            still holding her hand. "It never gets any easier, Winifred." 
         </p>
         
         <p>They both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside. Alexander
            sat down and leaned his head on his hand. His wife bent over him. "Courage," she
            said gayly. Bartley rose and rang the bell. Thomas brought him his hat and stick
            and ulster. At the sight of these, the supercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted
            her red cushion by the
            fire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous indications of
            change. Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then plunged into his coat and drew
            on his gloves. His wife held his stick, smiling. Bartley smiled too, and his
            eyes cleared. "I'll work like the devil, Winifred, and be home again before you
            realize I've gone." He kissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the
            front door into the rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the
            driver was starting his melancholy, dripping black horses. Alexander sat with
            his hands clenched on his knees. As the carriage turned up the hill, he lifted
            one hand and brought it down violently. "This time"—he spoke aloud and
            through his set teeth—"this time I'm going to end it!" 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>On the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well  
            <a href="en116" id="en116.ref" class="footnote">to the stern,
               on the windward side
            </a>  where the chairs were few, his rugs over him and the collar
            of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears. The weather had so far been dark
            and raw. For two hours he had been watching the low, dirty sky and the beating
            of the heavy rain upon the iron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that
            made exercise laborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid
            that drops of moisture kept gathering upon
            his hair and mustache. He seldom moved except to brush them away. The great open
            spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him. He
            intended during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all
            this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion. Deep down
            in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and strengthening, ebbing and
            flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on as steadily as his
            pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was submerged in the vast
            impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals the sidelong roll of the boat
            measured off time like the ticking of a clock. He felt released from everything
            that troubled and perplexed him. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted
            torturing memories, had actually managed to get on board without them. He
            thought of nothing at all. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the
            grayness, it was Lucius Wilson's, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten
            for years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to hunt
            jackrabbits with when he was a boy. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Toward six o'clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and brought the
            swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet deck, piled his damp rugs
            over him again, and sat smoking, losing himself in the obliterating
            blackness and drowsing in the rush of the gale. Before he went below a few
            bright stars were pricked off between heavily moving masses of cloud. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander felt the
            need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he went on deck the
            sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white cloud, smoke-colored at
            the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water was roughish, a cold, clear
            indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley walked for two hours, and then stretched
            himself in the sun until lunch-time. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he walked the deck
            through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose continually. It was agreeable
            to come to himself again after several days of numbness and torpor. He stayed
            out until the last tinge of violet had faded from the water. There was literally
            a taste of life on his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of
            champagne. He was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than
            he had meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was almost
            deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy fur coat about
            his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen exhilaration. The moment he
            stepped, almost out of breath, behind the shelter of the stern, the
            wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of warm air, a sense of close and
            intimate companionship. He started back and tore his coat open as if something
            warm were actually clinging to him beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went
            into the saloon parlor, full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp
            wind. He threw himself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and
            played accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had
            followed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He played bridge
            until two o'clock in the morning, and managed to lose a considerable sum of
            money without really noticing that he was doing so. 
         </p>
         
         <p>After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently dull. When
            the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun did no more
            than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark brightness of newly
            cut lead. Through one after another of those gray days Alexander drowsed and
            mused, drinking in the grateful moisture. But the complete peace of the first
            part of the voyage was over. Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if
            driven out, and paced the deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for
            walking in rough weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his
            abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied
            he must be thinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever
            bridge in Canada. 
         </p>
         
         <p>But Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night out, when
            his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been continually hammering
            away at himself. More and more often, when he first wakened in the morning or
            when he stepped into a warm place after being chilled on the deck, he felt a
            sudden painful delight at being nearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most
            despondent, when he thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a
            flash he was free of it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness
            of himself. On the instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness,
            the intense excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth.

      <h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>
      
      <p>T
         <span class="smallcaps">HE</span> last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The
         stop at  
         <a href="en117" id="en117.ref" class="footnote">Queenstown</a> , the tedious passage up  
         <a href="en118" id="en118.ref" class="footnote">the Mersey</a> , were things that he noted
         dimly through his growing impatience. He had planned to stop in  
         <a href="en119" id="en119.ref" class="footnote">Liverpool</a> ; but,
         instead, he took the  
         <a href="en120" id="en120.ref" class="footnote">boat train</a>  for London. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Emerging at  
         <a href="en121" id="en121.ref" class="footnote">Euston</a>  at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his
         luggage sent to  
         <a href="en122" id="en122.ref" class="footnote">the Savoy</a>  and drove at once to Bedford Square. When Marie met
         him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her
         surprise and delight. She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her
         confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway,
         buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to
         Hilda's living-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was
         crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to
         grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood his ground over by the
         windows until Hilda came in. She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift
         flight across the room she felt a change in him
         and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She
         merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on
         either shoulder. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke
         this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be
         Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never dreamed it would be
         you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like this? Come over to the fire;
         you're chilled through." 
      </p>
      
      <p>She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the
         opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a
         happy little girl. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You have n't spoken a word."</p>
      
      <p>"I got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and came
         down on the boat train." Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before
         the blaze. Hilda watched him with perplexity. "There's something troubling you,
         Bartley. What is it?" Bartley bent lower over the fire. "It's the whole thing
         that troubles me, Hilda. You and I." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda took a quick, soft breath. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big,
         determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice. </p>
      
      <p>He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to
         the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a
         street vendor began to call under the window. At last Alexander brought out one
         word:— 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Everything!" </p>
      
      <p>Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright. She looked about
         desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to
         Bartley. She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back
         upon her stool. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously. "I can't stand
         seeing you miserable." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I can't live with myself any longer," he answered roughly. </p>
      
      <p>He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the
         room, seeming to find it too small for him. He pulled up a window as if the air
         were heavy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows
         growing about her eyes. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"It . . . it has n't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her
         lips quivered. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Always. But it's worse now. It's unbearable. It tortures me every minute." </p>
      
      <p>"But why 
         <em>now?</em>" she asked piteously, wringing her hands. 
      </p>
      
      <p>He ignored her question. "I am not a man who can live two lives," he went on
         feverishly. "Each life spoils the other. I get nothing but misery out of either.
         The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
         There is this deception between me and everything." 
      </p>
      
      <p>At that word "deception," spoken with such self-contempt, the color
         flashed back into Hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck
         by a whiplash. She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped
         tightly in front of her. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Could you—could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if
         I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire. "It was myself I was defying,
         Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out." 
      </p>
      
      <p>He looked at her and his haggard face softened. He put out his hand toward her as
         he looked away again into the fire. 
      </p>
      
      <p>She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her. "When did you first begin
         to feel like this, Bartley?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"After the very first. The first was—sort of in play, was n't it?" </p>
      
      <p>Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been. But
         why did n't you tell me when you were here in the summer?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander groaned. "I meant to, but somehow I could n't. We had only a few days,
         and your new play was just on, and you were so happy." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Yes, I was happy, was n't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Were
         n't you happy then, at all?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance
         of those days. Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander,
         too. He moved uneasily and his chair creaked. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Yes, I was then. You know. But afterward . . . " </p>
      
      <p>"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it
         stole back to his coat sleeve. "Please tell me one thing, Bartley. At least,
         tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy." 
      </p>
      
      <p>His hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeve. "Yes,
         Hilda; I know that," he said simply. 
      </p>
      
      <p>She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:— </p>
      
      <p>"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything. I wanted you to eat
         all the cakes and have them, too. I somehow believed that I could take all the
         bad consequences for you. I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and
         successful—to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and,
         once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening
         lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle
         together. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I did n't know. You've only to tell me
         now. What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened
         intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair. "You want me to
         say it?" she whispered. "You want to tell me that you can only see me like this,
         as old friends do, or out in the world among people? I can do that." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I can't," he said heavily. </p>
      
      <p>Hilda shivered and sat still. Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke
         through his teeth. "It's got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can't see you at all,
         anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no
         matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda sprang up like a flame. She stood over him with her hands
         clenched at her side, her body rigid. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"No!" she gasped. "It's too late to ask that. Do you hear me, Bartley? It's too
         late. I won't promise. It's abominable of you to ask me. Keep away if you wish;
         when have I ever followed you? But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit. The
         shamefulness of your asking me to do that! If you come to me, I'll do as I see
         fit. Do you understand? Bartley, you're cowardly!" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. "Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid
         of myself. I don't trust myself any more. I carried it all lightly enough at
         first, but now I don't dare trifle with it. It's getting the better of
         me. It's different now. I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here
         with you. It's through him that I've come to wish for you all and all the time."
         He took her roughly in his arms. "Do you know what I mean?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly. "Oh, Bartley, what
         am I to do? Why did n't you let me be angry with you? You ask me to stay away
         from you because you want me! And I've got nobody but you. I will do anything
         you say—but that! I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have
         
         <em>something!</em>" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again. Hilda sat on the arm of it
         and put her hands lightly on his shoulders. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Just something, Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months and
         months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The sight of you,
         Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful—can I never make
         you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently. "You
         see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different. If I'd met
         you later, if I had n't loved you so well—but that's all over, long
         ago. Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged;
         those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding— hard as
         a steel spring. And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no
         difference." 
      </p>
      
      <p>She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up
         any longer. Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and
         her wet, tired eyes. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered. "We've tortured each other enough for
         to-night. Forget everything except that I am here." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I think I have forgotten everything but that already," she murmured. "Ah, your
         dear arms!" 
      </p>

      <h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>
      
      <p>D
         <span class="smallcaps">URING</span> the fortnight that Alexander was in London he drove himself
         hard. He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great many men
         who were doing interesting things in his own profession. He disliked to think of
         his visits to London as holidays, and when he was there he worked even harder
         than he did at home. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one. The thick
         air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a golden dawn and
         then fell off to a fresh breeze. When Bartley looked out of his windows from the
         Savoy, the river was flashing silver and the gray stone along the
         Embankment was bathed in bright, clear sunshine. London had wakened to life
         after three weeks of cold and sodden rain. Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and
         went over his mail while the hotel valet packed his trunks. Then he paid his
         account and walked rapidly down  
         <a href="en123" id="en123.ref" class="footnote">the Strand past</a> 
          
         <a href="en124" id="en124.ref" class="footnote">Charing Cross Station</a> . His
         spirits rose with every step, and when he reached  
         <a href="en125" id="en125.ref" class="footnote">Trafalgar Square</a> , blazing in
         the sun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the bright air,
         he signaled to
         a hansom, and, before he knew what he was about, told the driver to go to
         Bedford Square by way of the British Museum. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When he reached Hilda's apartment she met him, fresh as the morning itself. Her
         rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he
         had been sending her. She would never let him give her anything else. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Are you busy this morning, Hilda?" he asked as he sat down, his hat and gloves
         in his hand. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Very. I've been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open in
         February, you know." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, then you've worked enough. And so have I. I've seen all my men, my packing
         is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening. But this morning we are going to
         have a holiday. What do you say to a drive out to  
         <a href="en126" id="en126.ref" class="footnote">Kew and Richmond</a> ? You may not
         get another day like this all winter. It's like a fine April day at home. May I
         use your telephone? I want to order the carriage." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Oh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are telephoning I'll
         change my dress. I shan't be long. All the morning papers are on the table." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a broad fur
         hat. Bartley rose and inspected her. "Why don't you wear some of those pink
         roses?" he asked. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"But they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open. I was
         saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!" She laughed as she looked about the
         room. "You've been sending me far too many flowers, Bartley. New ones
         every day. That's too often; though I do love to open the boxes, and I take good
         care of them." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Why won't you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you are so fond
         of ? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass. "No,  
         <a href="en127" id="en127.ref" class="footnote">there
            are some things you can't do
         </a> . There's the carriage. Will you button my gloves
         for me?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Bartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove. "How gay
         your eyes are this morning, Hilda." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"That's because I've been studying. It always stirs me up a little." </p>
      
      <p>He pushed the top of the glove up slowly. "When did you learn to take hold of
         your parts like that?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"When I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting. What a
         shocking while you take." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'm in no hurry. We've plenty of time." </p>
      
      <p>They found all London abroad.  
         <a href="en128" id="en128.ref" class="footnote">Piccadilly</a>  was a stream of rapidly moving carriages, from which flashed furs and
         flowers and bright winter costumes. The metal trappings of the
         harnesses shone dazzingly, and the wheels were revolving disks that threw off
         rays of light. The parks were full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs
         that leaped and yelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'm not going until to-morrow, you know," Bartley announced suddenly. "I'll cut
         off a day in Liverpool. I have n't felt so jolly this long while." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad. "I think
         people were meant to be happy, a little," she said. 
      </p>
      
      <p>They had lunch at Richmond and then walked to  
         <a href="en129" id="en129.ref" class="footnote">Twickenham</a> , where they had sent the
         carriage. They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind them, toward the
         distant gold-washed city. It was one of those rare afternoons when all the
         thickness and shadow of London are changed to a kind of shining, pulsing,
         special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors become fluttering golden
         clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when all that bleakness of gray stone
         and dullness of dirty brick trembles in aureate light, and all the roofs and
         spires, and one great dome, are floated in golden haze. On such rare
         afternoons the ugliest of cities becomes the most beautiful, the most prosaic becomes
         the most poetic, and months of
         sodden days are offset by a moment of miracle. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"It's like that with us Londoners, too," Hilda was saying. "Everything is awfully
         grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways of amusing
         ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody.  
         <a href="en130" id="en130.ref" class="footnote">We can go mad with joy, as the
            people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday
         </a> . We make the most of our
         moment." 
      </p>
      
      <p>She thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and Bartley
         looked down at her and laughed. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"You are a plucky one, you." He patted her glove with his hand. "Yes, you are a
         plucky one." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda sighed. "No, I'm not. Not about some things, at any rate. It does n't take
         pluck to fight for one's moment, but it takes pluck to go without—a
         lot. More than I have. I can't help it," she added fiercely. 
      </p>
      
      <p>After miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached London
         itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming up from the
         river, that betokened fog again to-morrow. The streets were full of people who
         had worked indoors all through the priceless day and had now come hungrily out
         to drink the muddy lees of it. They stood in long black lines, waiting before the
         pit entrances of the theatres—short-coated boys, 
         and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and chatting gayly. There was a blurred
         rhythm in all the dull city noises—in the clatter of the cab horses
         and the rumbling of the busses, in the street calls, and in the undulating
         tramp, tramp of the crowd. It was like the deep vibration of some vast
         underground machinery, and like the muffled pulsations of millions of
         human hearts. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Seems good to get back, does n't it?" Bartley whispered, as they drove from
          
         <a href="en131" id="en131.ref" class="footnote">Bayswater Road</a>  into  
         <a href="en132" id="en132.ref" class="footnote">Oxford Street</a> . "London always makes me want to live more
         than any other city in the world. You remember  
         <a href="en133" id="en133.ref" class="footnote">our priestess mummy over in the
            mummy-room
         </a> , and how we used to long to go and bring her out on nights like this?
         Three thousand years! Ugh!" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"All the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and watched her
         and wished her well. I believe she used to remember," Hilda said thoughtfully. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I hope so. Now let's go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before we go
         home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night. Where shall I
         tell the driver? The  
         <a href="en134" id="en134.ref" class="footnote">Piccadilly Restaurant</a> ? The music's good there." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"There are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little French place
         in  
         <a href="en135" id="en135.ref" class="footnote">Soho</a> , where we went so often when you were
         here in the summer? I love it, and I've never been there with any one but you.
         Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Very well, the sole's good there. How many  
         <a href="en136" id="en136.ref" class="footnote">street pianos</a>  there are about
         to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We've had five miles of
          
         <a href="en137" id="en137.ref" class="footnote">'Il Trovatore'</a>  now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are you comfy, and not too
         tired?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I'm not tired at all. I was just wondering how people can ever die. Why did you
         remind me of the mummy? Life seems the strongest and most indestructible thing
         in the world. Do you really believe that all those people rushing about down
         there, going to good dinners and clubs and theatres, will be dead some day, and
         not care about anything? I don't believe it, and I know I shan't die, ever! You
         see, I feel too—too powerful!" 
      </p>
      
      <p>The carriage stopped. Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the pavement.
         As he lifted her in his two hands he whispered: "You are—powerful!" 
      </p>

      <h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>
      
      <p>T
         <span class="smallcaps">HE</span> last rehearsal was over, a tedious dress rehearsal which had
         lasted all day and exhausted the patience of everyone who had to do with it.
         When Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her dressing-room, she
         found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the corridor. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"The fog's thicker than ever, Hilda. There have been a great many accidents
         to-day. It's positively unsafe for you to be out alone. Will you let me take you
         home?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"How good of you, Mac. If you are going with me, I think I'd rather walk. I've
         had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"I should n't wonder," said MacConnell dryly. Hilda pulled down her veil and they
         stepped out into the  
         <a href="en138" id="en138.ref" class="footnote">thick brown wash</a>  that submerged  
         <a href="en139" id="en139.ref" class="footnote">St. Martin's Lane</a> .
         MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his arm. "I'm sorry I was
         such a savage. I hope you did n't think I made an ass of myself." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Not a bit of it. I don't wonder you were peppery. Those things are awfully trying.
         How do you think it's going?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Magnificently. That's why I got so stirred up. We are going to hear from this,
         both of us. And that reminds me; I've got news for you. They are going to begin
         repairs on the theatre about the middle of March, and we are to  
         <a href="en140" id="en140.ref" class="footnote">run over to New
            York for six weeks
         </a> . Bennett told me yesterday that it was decided." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her. He was the only
         thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense opaqueness, as if they
         were walking at the bottom of the ocean. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Oh, Mac, how glad I am! And they love your things over there, don't they?" </p>
      
      <p>"Shall you be glad for—any other reason, Hilda?" </p>
      
      <p>MacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object. It proved
         to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the edge of the pavement. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"What do you mean, Mac?" Hilda asked nervously. </p>
      
      <p>"I was just thinking there might be people over there you'd be glad to see," he
         brought out awkwardly. Hilda said nothing, and as they walked on MacConnell
         spoke again, apologetically: "I hope you don't mind my knowing about it, Hilda.
         Don't stiffen up like that. No one else knows, and I did n't try to find out
         anything. I felt it, even before I knew who he was. I knew there was somebody, and
         that it was n't I." 
      </p>
      
      <p>They crossed  
         <a href="en141" id="en141.ref" class="footnote">Oxford Street</a>  in silence, feeling their way. The busses had stopped
         running and the cabdrivers were leading their horses. When they reached the
         other side, MacConnell said suddenly, "I hope you are happy." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Terribly, dangerously happy, Mac,"—Hilda spoke quietly, pressing the
         rough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"You've always thought me too old for you, Hilda,— oh, of course you've
         never said just that,—and here this fellow is not more than eight
         years younger than I. I've always felt that if I could get out of my old case I
         might win you yet. It's a fine, brave youth I carry inside me, only he'll never
         be seen." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Nonsense, Mac. That has nothing to do with it. It's because you seem too close
         to me, too much my own kind. It would be like marrying Cousin Mike, almost. I
         really tried to care as you wanted me to, away back in the beginning." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, here we are, turning out of the  
         <a href="en142" id="en142.ref" class="footnote">Square</a> . You are not angry with me, Hilda?
         Thank you for this walk, my dear. Go in and get dry things on at once. You'll be
         having a great night to-morrow." 
      </p>
      
      <p>She put out her hand. "Thank you, Mac, for everything. Good-night." </p>
      
      <p>MacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs. Her
         slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire. "I shall
         certainly see him in New York.  
         <a href="en143" id="en143.ref" class="footnote">He will see by the papers that we are coming</a> .
         Perhaps he knows it already," Hilda kept thinking as she undressed. "Perhaps he
         will be at the dock. No, scarcely that; but I may meet him in the street even
         before he comes to see me." Marie placed the tea-table by the fire and brought
         Hilda her letters. She looked them over, and started as she came to one in a
         handwriting that she did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice
         before, and he did not allow her to write to him at all. "Thank you, Marie. You
         may go now." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still unopened. She
         looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its thickness with her fingers.
         She believed that she sometimes had a kind of second-sight about letters, and
         could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings. She
         put this one down on the table in front of her while she poured her tea. At
         last, with a little shiver of expectancy, she tore open the envelope and
         read:— 
         
         
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <blockquote>

                  <div class="salute">My dear Hilda:—  </div>
                  
                  
                  <p>It is after twelve o'clock. Every one else is in bed and I am sitting alone in my
                     study. I have been happier in this room than anywhere else in the world.
                     Happiness like that makes one insolent. I used to think these four walls could
                     stand against anything. And now I scarcely know myself here. Now I know that no
                     one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person. Two people,
                     when they love each other, grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but
                     their moral natures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never
                     welded. The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to the end. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used to be
                     with me. Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it has been as if
                     a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all the smells of spring blew
                     in to me. There is a garden out there, with stars overhead, where I used to walk
                     at night when I had a single purpose and a single heart. I can remember how I
                     used to feel there, how beautiful everything about me was, and what life and
                     power and freedom I felt in myself. When the window opens I know exactly how it
                     would feel to be out there. But that garden is closed to me. How is it, I ask myself,
                     that everything can be so
                     different with me when nothing here has changed? I am in my own house, in my own
                     study, in the midst of all these quiet streets where my friends live. They are
                     all safe and at peace with themselves. But I am never at peace. I feel always on
                     the edge of danger and change. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I keep remembering  
                     <a href="en144" id="en144.ref" class="footnote">locoed horses</a>  I used to see on the range when I was a boy.
                     They changed like that. We used to catch them and put them up in the corral, and
                     they developed great cunning. They would pretend to eat their oats like the
                     other horses, but we knew they were always scheming to get back at the loco. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>It seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world. When he tries
                     to live a second, he develops another nature. I feel as if a second man had been
                     grafted into me. At first he seemed only a pleasure-loving simpleton, of whose
                     company I was rather ashamed, and whom I used to hide under my coat when I
                     walked the Embankment, in London. But now he is strong and sullen, and he is
                     fighting for his life at the cost of mine. That is his one activity: to grow
                     strong. No creature ever wanted so much to live. Eventually, I suppose, he will
                     absorb me altogether. Believe me, you will hate me then. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>And what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story? </p>
                  
                  <p>Nothing at all. The little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and
                     
                     <a href="en145" id="en145.ref" class="footnote">he became a stag</a> . I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and
                     because it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer. And because I suffer,
                     Hilda. If any one I loved suffered like this, I'd want to know it. Help me,
                     Hilda!

            <span class="smallcaps">N</span> the last Saturday in April, the New York "Times" published an account
            of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander's New Jersey bridge,
            and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on  
            <a href="en146" id="en146.ref" class="footnote">West Tenth
               Street
            </a> . 
         </p>
         
         <p>On Sunday, the day after this notice appeared, Alexander worked all day at his
            Tenth Street rooms. His business often called him to New York, and he had kept
            an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length
            of time. Besides his sleeping-room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a
            painter's studio, which he used as a study and office. It was furnished with the
            cast-off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered
            for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings.
            Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror. Alexander's big
            work-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung
            the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit,  
            <a href="en147" id="en147.ref" class="footnote">a study
               of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since
               become a portrait-painter of international renown
            </a> . He had done it for Alexander
            when they were students together in Paris. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>Sunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously. When Alexander came
            back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and
            settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets. It was
            after nine o'clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a
            sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his
            hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap. He rose and crossed
            the room quickly. When he threw open the door he recognized the figure that
            shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway. He stood for a moment in awkward
            constraint, his pipe in his hand. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her. He pointed
            to a chair by the fire and went back to his work-table. "Won't you sit down?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously.
            The yellow light from the student's lamp fell on his hands and the purple
            sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were
            in the shadow. There was something about him that made Hilda wish
            herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Of course I know, Bartley," she said at last, "that after this you won't owe me
            the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw that interview in the
            paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you. That's
            all. Good-night; I'm going now." She turned and her hand closed on the
            door-knob. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm. "Sit down, Hilda;
            you're wet through. Let me take off your coat—and your boots; they're
            oozing water." He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank
            into the chair. "Here, put your feet on this stool. You don't mean to say you
            walked down— and without overshoes!" 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda hid her face in her hands. "I was afraid to take a cab. Can't you see,
            Bartley, that I'm terribly frightened? I've been through this a hundred times
            to-day. Don't be any more angry than you can help. I was all right until I knew
            you were in town. If you'd sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything! But
            you won't let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that
            terrible letter you wrote me when you got home." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and began to brush
            the sleeve of his jacket. "Is this the way you
            mean to answer it, Hilda?" he asked unsteadily. 
         </p>
         
         <p>She was afraid to look up at him. "Did n't— did n't you mean even to
            say good-by to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to—quit me?" she asked.
            "I came to tell you that I'm willing to do as you asked me. But it's no use
            talking about that now. Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward
             
            <a href="en148" id="en148.ref" class="footnote">the fender</a> . 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair. "Did you think I had forgotten you
            were in town, Hilda? Do you think I kept away by accident? Did you suppose I did n't
            know you were sailing on Tuesday? There is a letter for you there, in my
            desk drawer. It was to have reached you on the steamer. I was all the morning
            writing it. I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of
            myself, a letter would be better than nothing. Marks on paper mean something to
            you." He paused. "They never did to me." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve. "Oh, Bartley!
            Did you write to me? Why did n't you telephone me to let me know that you had?
            Then I would n't have come." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander slipped his arm about her. "I did n't know it before, Hilda, on my
            honor I did n't, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping
            I might drive you to do just
            this. I've watched that door all day. I've jumped up if the fire crackled. I
            think I have felt that you were coming." He bent his face over her hair. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"And I," she whispered,—"I felt that you were feeling that. But when I
            came, I thought I had been mistaken." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room. </p>
         
         <p>"No, you were n't mistaken. I've been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged
            not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when your manager added
            two more weeks, I was already committed." He dropped upon the stool in front of
            her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees. "What am I to do, Hilda?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"That's what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I'm going to do what you asked
            me to do, when you were in London. Only I'll do it more completely. 
            <a href="en149" id="en149.ref" class="footnote"> I'm going to
               marry
            </a> ." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Who?" </p>
         
         <p>"Oh, it does n't matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I'm too fond of him." </p>
         
         <p>Alexander moved restlessly. "Are you joking, Hilda?" </p>
         
         <p>"Indeed I'm not." </p>
         
         <p>"Then you don't know what you're talking about." </p>
         
         <p>"Yes, I know very well. I've thought about it a great deal, and I've quite
            decided. I never used to understand how women did things like that, but I know
            now. It's because they can't be at the mercy of the man they love any longer." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander flushed angrily. "So it's better to be at the mercy of a man
            you don't love?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Under such circumstances, infinitely!" </p>
         
         <p>There was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander's fall. He got up and
            went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out. He heard Hilda moving
            about behind him. When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots. He
            went back and stood over her. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Hilda, you'd better think a while longer before you do that. I don't know what I
            ought to say, but I don't believe you'd be happy; truly I don't. Are n't you
            trying to frighten me?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly. "No; I'm
            telling you what I've made up my mind to do. I suppose I would better do it
            without telling you. But afterward I shan't have an opportunity to explain, for
            I shan't be seeing you again." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander started to speak, but caught himself. When Hilda rose he sat down on
            the arm of her chair and drew her back into it. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I would n't be so much alarmed if I did n't know how utterly reckless you 
            <em>can
               
            </em> be. Don't do anything like that rashly." His face grew troubled. "You would n't be
            happy. You are not that kind of woman. I'd never have another hour's
            peace if I helped to make you do a thing like that." He took her face between
            his hands and looked down into it. "You see, you are different, Hilda. Don't you
            know you are?" His voice grew softer, his touch more and more tender. "Some
            women can do that sort of thing, but you—you can love as queens did,
            in the old time." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before. She closed
            her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled. "Only one, Bartley. Only one. And he
            threw it back at me a second time." 
         </p>
         
         <p>She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly. </p>
         
         <p>"Try him again, Hilda. Try him once again." </p>
         
         <p>She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands. </p>

      <h4>CHAPTER X</h4>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>O
            <span class="smallcaps">N</span> Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in
            Vermont, was standing on the siding at  
            <a href="en150" id="en150.ref" class="footnote">White River Junction</a>  when the Canadian
            Express pulled by on its northward journey. As the day-coaches at the rear end
            of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at one of the windows a man's
            head, with thick rumpled hair. "Curious," he thought; "that looked like
            Alexander, but what would he be doing back there in the day-coaches?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>It was, indeed, Alexander. </p>
         
         <p>That morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that there was
            serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there at once, so he had
            caught the first train out of New York. He had taken a seat in a day-coach to
            avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and because he did not wish to be
            comfortable. When the telegram arrived, Alexander was at his rooms on Tenth
            Street, packing his bag to go to Boston. On Monday night he had written a long
            letter to his wife, but when morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter
            was still in his pocket. Winifred was not a woman who could bear
            disappointment. She demanded a great deal of herself and of the people she
            loved; and she never failed herself. If he told her now, he knew, it would be
            irretrievable. There would be no going back. He would lose the thing he valued
            most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own happiness. There
            would be nothing for him afterward. He seemed to see himself dragging out a
            restless existence on the Continent— 
            <a href="en151" id="en151.ref" class="footnote">Cannes</a> ,  
            <a href="en152" id="en152.ref" class="footnote">Hyères</a> ,
             
            <a href="en153" id="en153.ref" class="footnote">Algiers</a> ,  
            <a href="en154" id="en154.ref" class="footnote">Cairo</a> —among  
            <a href="en155" id="en155.ref" class="footnote">smartly dressed, disabled men</a>  of every
            nationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to catch
            trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning with a great
            bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no purpose and no
            meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late to shorten the day. 
         </p>
         
         <p>And for what? For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he could not
            let go. 
            <em>And he could even let it go,</em> he told himself. But he had promised
            to be in London at midsummer, and he knew that he would go. . . . It was
            impossible to live like this any longer. 
         </p>
         
         <p>And this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had foreseen for
            him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust. And he could not
            understand how it had come about. He felt that he himself was unchanged, that he
            was still there, the same man he had been five years ago, and that he was
            sitting stupidly by and letting some resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life
            for him. This new force was not he, it was but a part of him. He would not even
            admit that it was stronger than he; but it was more active. It was by its energy
            that this new feeling got the better of him. His wife was the woman who had made
            his life, gratified his pride, given direction to his tastes and habits. The
            life they led together seemed to him beautiful. Winifred still was, as she had
            always been, Romance for him, and whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to
            her. When the grandeur and beauty of the world challenged him— as it
            challenges even the most self-absorbed people— he always answered with
            her name. That was his reply to the question put by the mountains and the stars;
            to all the spiritual aspects of life. In his feeling for his wife there was all
            the tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was capable. There
            was everything but energy; the energy of youth which must register itself and
            cut its name before it passes. This new feeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and
            light of foot. It ran and was not wearied, anticipated him everywhere. It put  
            <a href="en156" id="en156.ref" class="footnote">a
               girdle round the earth
            </a>  while he was going from New York to Moorlock. At this moment, it was tingling through
            him, exultant, and live as
             
            <a href="en157" id="en157.ref" class="footnote">quicksilver</a> , whispering, "In July you will be in England." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Already he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish coast, the
            sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train through
            the summer country. He closed his eyes and gave himself up to the feeling of
            rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts. He was sitting so, his face
            shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him from the siding at White
            River Junction. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to sunset. The
            train was passing through a gray country and the sky overhead was
            flushed with a wide flood of clear color. There was a
            rose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows. Off to the left,
            under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a group of boys were
            sitting around a little fire. The smell of the wood smoke blew in at the window.
            Except for an old farmer, jogging along the highroad in his box-wagon, there was
            not another living creature to be seen. Alexander looked back wistfully at the
            boys, camped on the edge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and
            looking gravely at their fire. They took his mind back a long way, to a  
            <a href="en158" id="en158.ref" class="footnote">campfire
               on a sandbar in a Western river
            </a> , and he wished he could go back and sit down with them. He could
            remember exactly how the world had looked then. 
         </p>
         
         <p>It was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it occurred
            to him that the train must be nearing Allway. In going to his new bridge at
            Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway. The train stopped at  
            <a href="en159" id="en159.ref" class="footnote">Allway
               Mills
            </a> , then wound two miles up the river, and then the hollow sound under his
            feet told Bartley that he was on his first bridge again. The bridge seemed
            longer than it had ever seemed before, and he was glad when he felt the beat of
            the wheels on the solid roadbed again. He did not like coming and going across
            that bridge, or remembering the man who built it. And was he, indeed, the same
            man who used to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and
            to the stars? And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet hills
            sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge reaching out into
            the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big white house; upstairs, in
            Winifred's window, the light that told him she was still awake and still
            thinking of him. And after the light went out he walked alone, taking the
            heavens into his confidence, unable to tear himself away from the white magic of
            the night, unwilling to sleep because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for
            the first time since first the hills were
            hung with moonlight, there was a lover in the world.  
            <a href="en160" id="en160.ref" class="footnote">And always there was the
               sound of the rushing water underneath, the sound which, more than anything else,
               meant death; the wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces
               which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish. Then, in the exaltation
               of love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other thing as
               strong as love. Under the moon, under the cold, splendid stars, there were only
               those two things awake and sleepless; death and love, the rushing river and his
               burning heart
            </a> . 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander sat up and looked about him. The train was tearing on through the
            darkness. All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or sleeping
            heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low. How came he here among all these
            dirty people? Why was he going to London? What did it mean—what was
            the answer? How could this happen to a man who had lived through that magical
            spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars themselves were but
            flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of his love? 
         </p>
         
         <p>What had he done to lose it? How could he endure the baseness of life without it?
            And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the unquiet quicksilver in his
            breast told him that at midsummer he would be in London. He remembered his
            last night there: the red foggy darkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres,
            the hand-organs, the feverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the
            feeling of letting himself go with the crowd. He shuddered and looked about him
            at the poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and travel-stained,
            now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to stand to him for the ugliness
            he had brought into the world. 
         </p>
         
         <p>And those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he wished he
            could promise them better luck. Ah, if one could promise any one better luck, if
            one could assure a single human being of happiness! He had thought he could do
            so, once; and it was thinking of that that he at last fell asleep. In his sleep,
            as if it had nothing fresher to work upon, his mind went back and tortured
            itself with something years and years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his
            childhood. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through pale golden
            ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating through the pine
            woods. The  
            <a href="en161" id="en161.ref" class="footnote">white birches</a> , with their little unfolding leaves, gleamed in the
            lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already coming to life with their first
            green, a thin, bright color which had run over them like fire. As the train rushed
            along
            the trestles, thousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light. The sky was
            already a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal. Bartley caught up his bag
            and hurried through the  
            <a href="en162" id="en162.ref" class="footnote">Pullman coaches</a>  until he found the conductor. There was
            a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set about changing his clothes. Last
            night he would not have believed that anything could be so pleasant as the cold
            water he dashed over his head and shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on
            his body. 
         </p>
         
         <p>After he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into his lungs
            deep breaths of the pine-scented air. He had awakened with all his old sense of
            power. He could not believe that things were as bad with him as they had seemed
            last night, that there was no way to set them entirely right. Even if he went to
            London at midsummer, what would that mean except that he was a fool? And he had
            been a fool before. That was not the reality of his life. Yet he knew that he
            would go to London. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Half an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock. Alexander sprang to the
            platform and hurried up the siding, waving to  
            <a href="en163" id="en163.ref" class="footnote">Philip Horton, one of his
               assistants
            </a> , who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the coaches. Bartley took his arm
            and they went together into the station buffet. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I'll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what seems to be
            the matter up here?" 
         </p>
         
         <p>The young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation. </p>
         
         <p>But Alexander cut him short. "When did you stop work?" he asked sharply. </p>
         
         <p>The young engineer looked confused. "I have n't stopped work yet, Mr. Alexander.
            I did n't feel that I could go so far without definite authorization from you." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Then why did n't you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and ask for
            your authorization? You'd have got it quick enough." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Well, really, Mr. Alexander, I could n't be absolutely sure, you know, and I did
            n't like to take the responsibility of making it public." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander pushed back his chair and rose. "Anything I do can be made public,
            Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing strain, and that
            even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet you've gone on adding
            weight." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here yesterday.  
            <a href="en164" id="en164.ref" class="footnote">My
               first telegram missed you somehow
            </a> . I sent one Sunday evening, to the same address, but it was returned to
            me." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Have you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire." </p>
         
         <p>Alexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following message to his
            wife:— 
         </p>
         
         <p>I may have to be here for some time. Can you come up at once? Urgent. </p>
         
         <p>Bartley. </p>
         
         <p>The Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town. When they were seated in the
            carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant further. If it were true
            that the  
            <a href="en165" id="en165.ref" class="footnote">compression members</a>  showed strain, with the bridge only two thirds
            done, then there was  
            <a href="en166" id="en166.ref" class="footnote">nothing to do but pull the whole structure down and begin
               over again
            </a> . Horton kept repeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong
            with the estimates. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander grew impatient. "That's all true, Phil, but we never were justified in
            assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an ordinary bridge would work
            with anything of such length. It's all very well on paper, but it remains to be
            seen whether it can be done in practice. I should have thrown up the job when
            they crowded me. It's all nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing
            when you know they're not sound." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"But just now, when there is such competition," the younger man demurred. "And
            certainly that's the new line of development." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. </p>
         
         <p>When they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination immediately.
            An hour later he sent for the superintendent. "I think you had better stop work
            out there at once, Dan. I should say that the lower chord here might buckle at
            any moment. I told  
            <a href="en167" id="en167.ref" class="footnote">the Commission</a>  that we were using higher unit stresses than
            any practice has established, and we've put the dead load at a low estimate.
             
            <a href="en168" id="en168.ref" class="footnote">Theoretically it worked out well enough, but it had never actually been tried</a> ."
            Alexander put on his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm. "Don't
            look so  
            <a href="en169" id="en169.ref" class="footnote">chopfallen</a> , Dan. It's a jolt, but we've got to face it. It is n't the
            end of the world, you know. Now we'll go out and call the men off quietly.
            They're already nervous, Horton tells me, and there's no use alarming them. I'll
            go with you, and we'll send the  
            <a href="en170" id="en170.ref" class="footnote">end riveters</a>  in first." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Alexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the long span.
            They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was doing, as if they
            were on an ordinary round of inspection. When they reached the end of the river
            span, Alexander nodded to the superintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman.
            The men in the end
            gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each other, started back
            across the bridge toward the river-bank. Alexander himself remained standing
            where they had been working, looking about him. It was hard to believe, as he
            looked back over it, that the whole great span was incurably disabled, was
            already as good as condemned, because something was out of line in the  
            <a href="en171" id="en171.ref" class="footnote">lower
               chord of the cantilever arm
            </a> . 
         </p>
         
         <p>The end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the tool-houses,
            and the second gang had picked up their tools and were starting toward the
            shore. Alexander, still standing at the end of the river span, saw the lower
            chord of the cantilever arm give a little, like an elbow bending. He shouted and
            ran after the second gang, but by this time every one knew that the big river
            span was slowly settling. There was a burst of shouting that was immediately
            drowned by the scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work
            began to pull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of
            tons of iron-work, all riveted together and lying in midair without support. It
            tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises that were like the
            shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of any kind; the bridge had no impetus
            except from its own
            weight. It lurched neither to right nor left, but  
            <a href="en172" id="en172.ref" class="footnote">sank almost in a vertical
               line
            </a> , snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part
            could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of the men
            jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore. 
         </p>
         
         <p>At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the downstream
            side of the bridge. He struck the water without injury and disappeared. He was
            under the river a long time and had great difficulty in holding his breath. When
            it seemed impossible, and his chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his
            wife telling him that he could hold out a little longer. An instant later his
            face cleared the water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had
            realized what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last
            abandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew he should
            live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at last, he felt sure of
            himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him that he had been through
            something of this sort before. There was nothing horrible about it. This, too,
            was life, and life was activity, just as it was in Boston or in London. He was
            himself, and there was something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural.
            Alexander was a strong swimmer, but he had
            gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the bridge itself, which had been settling
            faster and faster, crashed into the water behind him. Immediately the river was
            full of drowning men. A gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He
            thought he had cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching
            at him and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either hurt or
            crazed with fright.  
            <a href="en173" id="en173.ref" class="footnote">Alexander tried to beat them off</a> , but there were too many of
            them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped him about the middle, and
            they went down together. When he sank, his wife seemed to be there in the water
            beside him, telling him to keep his head, that if he could hold out the men
            would drown and release him. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but
            he could not think clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered
            what it was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="section ">
         
         <p>The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following night. By
            the next morning  
            <a href="en174" id="en174.ref" class="footnote">forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the river, but there
               were still twenty missing
            </a> . Many of the men had fallen with the bridge and were
            held down under the débris. Early on the morning of the second day a closed carriage
            was driven slowly along the
            river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled and
            churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line two thirds
            across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and word soon spread among
            the crowds on the shore that its occupant was the wife of the  
            <a href="en175" id="en175.ref" class="footnote">Chief Engineer</a> ;
            his body had not yet been found. The widows of the lost workmen, moving up and
            down the bank with shawls over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked
            at the rusty hired hack many times that morning. They drew near it and walked
            about it, but none of them ventured to peer within. Even half-indifferent
            sight-seers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: "You see that carriage
            over there? That's Mrs. Alexander. They have n't found him yet. She got off the
            train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in Boston
            yesterday—heard the newsboys crying it in the street." 
         </p>
         
         <p>At noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a tin
            coffee-pot from the camp kitchen. When he reached the carriage he found Mrs.
            Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning, leaning forward a
            little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking at the river. Hour after
            hour she had been watching the water, the lonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed
            mass
            of iron wreckage over which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Those poor women out there, do they blame him very much?" she asked, as she
            handed the coffee-cup back to Horton. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Nobody blames him, Mrs. Alexander. If any one is to blame, I'm afraid it's I. I
            should have stopped work before he came. He said so as soon as I met him. I
            tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram missed him, somehow. He did n't
            have time really to explain to me. If he'd got here Monday, he'd have had
            all the men off at once. But, you see, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never
            happened before. According to all human calculations, it simply could n't
            happen." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not had his
            clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent excitement was
            beginning to wear off. 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Don't be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don't leave me to the dread of
            finding out things that people may be saying. If he is blamed, if he needs any
            one to speak for him,"—for the first time her voice broke and a
            flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept over her rigid
            pallor,—"if he needs any one, tell me, show me what to do." She began to sob, and
            Horton hurried away. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When he came back at four o'clock in the afternoon he was carrying his hat in his
            hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had found Bartley. She
            opened the carriage door before he reached her and stepped to the ground. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Horton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly: "Won't you
            drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up there." 
         </p>
         
         <p>"Take me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble." </p>
         
         <p>The group of men down under the river-bank fell back when they saw a woman
            coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher. They took off
            their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although she had pulled her veil
            down over her face they did not look up at her. She was taller than Horton, and
            some of the men thought she was the tallest woman they had ever seen. "As tall
            as himself," some one whispered. Horton motioned to the men, and six of them
            lifted the stretcher and began to carry it up the embankment. Winifred followed
            them the half-mile to Horton's house. She walked quietly, without once breaking
            or stumbling. When the bearers put the stretcher down in Horton's spare bedroom, she
            thanked them and gave her hand to each in turn.
            The men went out of the house and through the yard with their caps in their
            hands. They were too much confused to say anything as they went down the hill. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Horton himself was almost as deeply perplexed. "Mamie," he said to his wife, when
            he came out of the spare room half an hour later, "will you take Mrs. Alexander
            the things she needs? She is going to do everything herself. Just stay about
            where you can hear her and go in if she wants you." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Everything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of prescience under
            the river. With her own hands she washed him clean of every mark of disaster.
            All night he was alone with her in the still house, his great head lying deep in
            the pillow. In the pocket of his coat Winifred found the letter that he had
            written her the night before he left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but
            because of its length, she knew it had been meant for her. 
         </p>
         
         <p>For Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled upon him
            consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end.  
            <a href="en176" id="en176.ref" class="footnote">His harshest critics
               did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have retrieved himself
            </a> . Even Lucius
            Wilson did not see in this accident the disaster he had once foretold. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say whether he did
            well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to be. The mind that
            society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable machine, dedicated to its

      <h4>EPILOGUE</h4>
      
      <p>P
         <span class="smallcaps">ROFESSOR</span> Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was just
         back from a visit to America. One afternoon, soon after his return, he put on
         his  
         <a href="en177" id="en177.ref" class="footnote">frock-coat</a>  and drove in a hansom to pay a call upon Hilda Burgoyne, who
         still lived at her old number, off Bedford Square. He and Miss Burgoyne had been
         fast friends for a long time. He had first noticed her about the corridors of
         the British Museum, where he read constantly. Her being there so often had made
         him feel that he would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible
         person, an introduction was not difficult. The preliminaries once over, they
         came to depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day's
         reading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea. They had much more in
         common than their memories of a common friend. Indeed, they seldom spoke of him.
         They saved that for the deep moments which do not come often, and then their
         talk of him was mostly silence. Wilson knew that Hilda had loved him; more than
         this he had not tried to know. 
      </p>
      
      <p>It was late when Wilson reached Hilda's apartment on this particular December afternoon,
         and he found her alone. She sent for
         fresh tea and made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people
         comfortable. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"How good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays
         without you. You've helped me over a good many Christmases." She smiled at him
         gayly. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"As if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed 
         <em>you</em>. How well
         you are looking, my dear, and how rested." 
      </p>
      
      <p>He peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long fingers
         together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with years. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. "That means that I was looking
         very seedy at the end of the season, does n't it? Well, we must show wear at
         last, you know." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Wilson took the cup gratefully. "Ah, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has
         just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries. I was most
         gently treated—as a sort of precious relic. But, do you know, it made
         me feel awkward to be hanging about still." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Seventy? Never mention it to me." Hilda looked appreciatively at the Professor's
         alert face, with so many kindly lines about
         the mouth and so many quizzical ones about the eyes. "You've got to hang about
         for me, you know. I can't even let you go home again. You must stay put, now
         that I have you back. You're the realest thing I have." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Wilson chuckled. "Dear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the spoils of
         conquered cities! You've really missed me? Well, then, I shall hang. Even if you
         have at last to put 
         <em>me</em> in the mummy-room with the others. You'll visit me
         often, won't you?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Every day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer, where you
         left them." She struck a match and lit one for him. "But you did, after all,
         enjoy being at home again?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Oh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a thousand miles
         apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the place. It was in Boston I
         lingered longest." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Ah, you saw Mrs. Alexander?" </p>
      
      <p>"Often. I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I should
         think. Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on. I found that I still
         loved to go to the house. It always seemed as if Bartley were there, somehow,
         and that at any moment one might hear his heavy tramp on the stairs. Do you know,
         I kept feeling that he must be up in his
         study." The Professor looked reflectively into the grate. "I should
         really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last long talk with
         him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Why?"</p>
      
      <p>Wilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so quickly that
         his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and pulled them awry. "Why?
         Why, dear me, I don't know. She probably never thought of it." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda bit her lip. "I don't know what made me say that. I did n't mean to
         interrupt. Go on, please, and tell me how it was." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, it was like that. Almost as if he were there. In a way, he really is
         there. She never lets him go. It's the most beautiful and dignified sorrow I've
         ever known. It's so beautiful that it has its compensations, I should think. Its
         very completeness is a compensation. It  
         <a href="en178" id="en178.ref" class="footnote">gives her a fixed star to steer by</a> . She
         does n't drift. We sat there evening after evening in the quiet of that
         magically haunted room, and watched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him.
         Felt him with a difference, of course." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand. "With a
         difference? Because of her, you mean?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Wilson's brow wrinkled. "Something like that, yes. Of course, as time goes on, to
         her he becomes more and more their simple personal relation." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda studied the droop of the Professor's head intently. "You did n't altogether
         like that? You felt it was n't wholly fair to him?" 
      </p>
      
      <p>Wilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses. "Oh, fair enough. More than
         fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a little different
         from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold absolutely all of a
         person. And I liked him just as he was; his deviations, too; the places where he
         did n't square." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda considered vaguely. "Has she grown much older?" she asked at last. </p>
      
      <p>"Yes, and no. In a tragic way she is even handsomer. But colder. Cold for
         everything but him.  
         <a href="en179" id="en179.ref" class="footnote">'Forget thyself to marble'</a> ; I kept thinking of that. Her
         happiness was a  
         <a href="en180" id="en180.ref" class="footnote">happiness 
            <em>à deux</em>
            
         </a> , not apart from the world,
         but actually against it. And now her grief is like that. She saves herself for
         it and does n't even go through the form of seeing people much. I'm sorry. It
         would be better for her, and might be so good for them, if she could let other
         people in." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Perhaps she's afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with somebody."
         Wilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm. "Dear me, it takes a
         woman to think of that, now! I don't, you know, think we ought to be hard on
         her. More, even, than the rest of us she did n't choose her destiny. She
         underwent it. And it has left her chilled. As to her not wishing to take the
         world into her confidence—well, it is a pretty brutal and stupid
         world, after all, you know." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Hilda leaned forward. "Yes, I know, I know. Only I can't help being glad that
         there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people. My little Marie
         worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when she has come to his
         picture." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Wilson nodded. "Oh, yes! He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He
         belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at
         the best. We should n't wonder too much at Mrs. Alexander. She must feel how
         useless it would be to stir about, that she may as well sit still; that nothing
         can happen to her after Bartley." 
      </p>
      
      <p>"Yes," said Hilda softly, "nothing can happen to one after Bartley." </p>
      
      <p>They both sat looking into the fire. </p>

         <p>T
            <span class="smallcaps">HE</span> conventional picture of the first novel by Willa Cather, 
            <em>Alexander's
               Bridge
            </em> (1912), is that it was a misstep in her career, that she was too
            infatuated with the examples of Henry James and Edith Wharton and had to outgrow
            a literary manner that ill-suited her before she embraced her most vital
            material, life on the Nebraska Divide. Cather came into her own, she herself
            said, when she "hit the home pasture" in her second novel, 
            <em>O Pioneers!
               
            </em> (1913). 
            <a href="hen1" id="hen1.ref" class="footnote"></a>  However, this view of the book is guided
            by the author's own published statements about her motives and her assessments
            of her creative origins. Because Cather made those three statements over a
            period of nearly twenty years, it is perhaps prudent to inspect them more
            closely, for in the absence of manuscripts, galleys, corrected proof sheets, or
            other forms of prepublication evidence, and with scant reference to
            
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> in her letters, we are inevitably drawn to
            Cather's published accounts of her first novel. 
         </p>
         
         <p>All three accounts raise as many questions as they answer. The first occurs in a
            brief interview in the 
            <em>New York Sun</em>, 25 May 1912, "Literary News, Views,
            and Criticism" (see Bohlke 6). There, Cather attempts to correct certain misapprehensions
            of her
            purposes: 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> is not an "industrial novel"; it is not a
            story about bridge building, but about a man who happened to build bridges. Nor
            is the title character patterned after an identifiable person. Instead, Bartley
            Alexander "simply has some of the characteristics which I have noticed in a
            dozen architects, engineers and inventors." And the interviewer's suspicion
            notwithstanding, Hilda Burgoyne does not resemble the actress Hilda
            Trevelyan. 
            <a href="hen2" id="hen2.ref" class="footnote"></a>  On the contrary, Cather says, she tried "to
            give the actress in this story certain qualities which I have found oftener in
            English actresses than in our own." The psychological dimension of the novel is
            likewise characterized in straightforward fashion: Alexander is a "pagan, a
            crude force, with little respect for anything but youth and work and power." He
            marries a woman of greater sophistication and with "more clearly defined
            standards," standards he can admire but only imperfectly comprehend. So long as
            he is fully engaged in his work, she continues, Alexander functions well, but
            "he runs the risk of encountering new emotional as well as new intellectual
            stimuli" (Bohlke 6). 
         </p>
         
         <p>In the light of Cather's subsequent comments, this account is interesting for
            several reasons. First, the novel's theme appears to be in keeping with the
            implied thematic coherence of her collection of short fiction titled 
            <em>The
               Troll Garden
            </em> (1905), expressed by epigrams Cather chose from Christina
            Rossetti and Charles Kingsley. 
            <a href="hen3" id="hen3.ref" class="footnote"></a>  As Bernice Slote observes,
            Alexander is something of a vigorous "forest child" inside a corrupting garden, who
            is in danger of the sort of dissipation and
            corruption that she had identified through the Kingsley epigram
            (xxv–xxvi). Second, nothing in Cather's statement indicates the
            influence of James or Wharton; instead, her commentary suggests a
            naturalistic approach to her subject. 
            <a href="hen4" id="hen4.ref" class="footnote"></a>  The forces that
            motivate her title character seem to be biological in nature and invite
            comparisons with Frank Norris's 
            <em>McTeague</em>, a novel she admiringly reviewed
            in 1899. 
            <a href="hen5" id="hen5.ref" class="footnote"></a>  As a social type, Alexander is in keeping with a
            figure Elizabeth Ammons has identified—the engineer as cultural hero.
            Instead of following the example of Richard Harding Davis or Harold Bell Wright,
            Ammons suggests, Cather may have been calling this fictional archetype into deep
            question. 
            <a href="hen6" id="hen6.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Finally, Cather, contrary to her later
            commentary, presents herself not as an inexperienced novelist or even a
            first-time novelist but as someone who knew what she was doing and why. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Over the next two decades, Cather gave two other accounts of the creation of
            
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>. The first served as a preface to a reissue of the
            novel in 1922, the second as the essay "My First Novels (There Were Two),"
            published in 
            <em>The Colophon</em> in 1931. In both instances, Cather looks back
            on the novel with a degree of skepticism. These essays substantially differ from
            the remarks in the earlier interview and somewhat from one another. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In the preface, Cather characterizes her writing of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> as
            a youthful mistake and herself as an "inexperienced writer": "Everything is new
            to the young writer, and everything seems equally personal" (195). She had not yet
            come to appreciate
            the familiar, the life she had lived as opposed to the life she sought out or
            observed. But the "people and the places of the story interested me intensely at
            the time when it was written, because they were new to me and were in themselves
            attractive" (195). 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> was essentially an "external" story
            written out of the stimulus of the "glitter of the passing show" (196). (Her use
            of this phrase is interesting because "The Passing Show" was the title of one of
            the weekly columns she wrote for the 
            <em>Nebraska State Journal</em> and, later,
            for the 
            <em>Lincoln Courier</em>.) Furthermore, she announces that her literary
            manner was somewhat imitative. The young writer must necessarily "have his
            affair with the external material he covets" and "strive to follow the masters
            he most admires, until he finds he is starving for reality and cannot make this
            go any longer" (197). In contrast, 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em> drew upon her natural
            material, and, borrowing from the language of Henri Bergson, she adds that it
            was written "with the wisdom of intuition as opposed to that of intellect"
            (197). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Of course, in 1912 Cather was not really an inexperienced writer. She was
            thirty-seven years old; her first essay had been published in 1891, her first
            short story the following year. By 1912 she had published a volume of poetry,
            
            <em>April Twilights</em> (1903), more than forty short stories, and 
            <em>The
               Troll Garden
            </em>. As early as 1905 she had completed a first novel, about
            which we know little except that it had been rejected by S. S. McClure and that
            Cather thought it not good enough to rework but too good to throw away (Woodress 182).
            Cather's
            characterization of herself probably has less to do with experience, or lack of
            it, than with a sense of having since come into her artistic maturity. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Similarly, most if not all of the interesting "people and places" that entered
            into the making of her novel were not necessarily "new" to Cather. As we shall
            see, most of those scenes derived from earlier visits to Europe: her first to
            England and the Continent with Isabelle McClung in 1902, a second to Italy in
            1908, and another to London and Paris in 1909. Cather never completely outgrew
            the stimulation she received from her first visit to Europe. As her longtime
            companion Edith Lewis notes, Cather's visit to Avignon on that first trip left a
            lasting impression: "She always wanted to write a story about Avignon; it was
            the subject of her last, unfinished story". 
         </p>
         
         <p>Passages in "My First Novels" provide yet another self-portrait of Cather as an
            artist. This essay is principally concerned with 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em>, a book
            Cather reimagines as her first novel because its creation was "spontaneous" (92)
            and natural to her, and was a "novel of the soil" before that sort of story had
            become fashionable (93). 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, by contrast, followed the
            "most conventional pattern": it was more or less set in London; it dealt with
            "interesting material," but only superficially and in the manner that painters
            call a "studio picture" (91); there was a great deal of "arranging" and
            "inventing" in it, because she had adopted the "conventional editorial point of
            view" (92); it was also conventional because it had a "hero" and "action" and "clever
            people" saying clever
            things. Finally, she suggests that, like most young writers at the time, she
            followed the literary manner of James and Wharton, "without having their
            qualifications" (93). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather added that shortly after finishing 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> she traveled
            to the desert Southwest, "a country I really did care about, and among people
            who were part of the country." The longer she stayed there, the more obvious it
            became to her how "unnecessary and superficial" 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> really
            was (92). If this is so, there is no hint of that attitude in her interview for
            the 
            <em>New York Sun</em>, given after she returned from Arizona. 
            <a href="hen7" id="hen7.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Perhaps more interesting is the suggestion that her natural material was
            no longer confined to Nebraska; it now extended to New Mexico and Arizona. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The differences among these statements can be attributed to nothing more
            significant than Cather's presentation of a revised but attractive artistic
            identity, something any shrewd professional writer is apt to do. The later
            essays were instances of recollection through the lens of time, and her
            assessments of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> were surely affected by her subsequent
            achievements and artistic growth. They usefully describe a writer finding her
            way at a critical point, and these very differences provoke questions about the
            novel itself. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Is 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> a "studio picture" filled with clever conversation?
            There is something of that, but the novel is by no means saturated with
            sophisticated banter. Much of the European setting is outdoors, not in the
            drawing room. More often we are given solitary walks or intimate carriage rides or
            Alexander
            and Hilda together in her apartment. Through dramatic presentation and
            recollection of Alexander's student days, Cather imagines the spectacle that is
            London or Paris, the city sights and revered public institutions, in preference
            to witty social scenes. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Does the novel actually reveal the fundamental influences of James and
            Wharton? 
            <a href="hen8" id="hen8.ref" class="footnote"></a>  While Cather may move her representative
            American character back and forth across the Atlantic, her novel is not
            "international" in the Jamesian sense. It does not render the Old World with the
            confidence derived from long acquaintance, nor does it inspect closely the
            cultural differences among several characters. Alexander is an American in
            London, where many admire him for his raw-boned energy and efficiency. But from
            the first, Professor Lucius Wilson directs the reader's attention to the true
            interest of Cather's title character: he is the "most tremendous response to
            stimuli I have ever known" (9); he is a "powerfully equipped nature" and has the
            "fascination of a scientific discovery" (17). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather had joined the staff of 
            <em>McClure's Magazine</em> in 1906, after working
            as a journalist and as a teacher. Her first important editorial assignment had
            been to rework Georgine Milmine's manuscript, 
            <em>Mary Baker G. Eddy: Her Life
               and the History of Christian Science
            </em>, which ran in fourteen installments
            in 
            <em>McClure's</em> from 1907 until 1909. The job had required her to spend much
            time in Boston, verifying Milmine's information, as well as rewriting the
            manuscript. This experience gave her the background for the Boston setting of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> as
            well as many new and stimulating acquaintances, such as Annie Fields and the
            writer Sarah Orne Jewett. 
         </p>
         
         <p>S. S. McClure liked Cather's work, but Cather found the job tedious and tiring.
            However, one consequence of her efforts was her appointment as managing editor
            of the magazine. McClure did not seem much interested in Cather's own artistic
            ambitions. Cather wrote to Jewett complaining that McClure wanted her to divide
            her time between writing in the manner of Ida Tarbell (on popular science and
            social issues) and running the office. Mr. McClure, she added somewhat bitterly,
            did not think much of her prospects as a writer; he believed she was better
            suited for the executive duties that continually left her tired and feeling she
            was missing out on life's more stimulating aspects (19 December 1908). Meantime,
            she was harried by illness, occupied with travel, and committed to a magazine
            that, though it had half a million readers, was in financial difficulty.
            Nevertheless, Cather was deeply involved in the literary culture, both in New
            York and, when editorial duties took her there, in London. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather had traveled to London in 1909, while still recuperating from an
            operation, and apparently anticipated a trip there in April 1911 and another in
            the spring of 1912: on 17 November 1911 she wrote to S. S. McClure saying that
            she would not go abroad if business at the magazine required her to stay in New
            York. 
            <a href="hen9" id="hen9.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Cather herself seems as anxious as Alexander
            often is to get back to London, though for different reasons. For Cather this desire
            was a cultural and geographical matter,
            whereas Alexander wants to be in London because Hilda and his lost youth seem to
            be there. Cather moves her title character back and forth across the Atlantic
            with such frequency that we might wonder whether his emotional dilemma and his
            eagerness to get back to London are plot devices designed to bring two realms of
            experience into conjunction. Although Alexander attends meetings, presumably to
            consult with British engineers about the Moorlock Bridge he is constructing in
            Quebec, engineering practices and building codes for bridge construction in
            Quebec were actually entirely a Canadian matter; they would not have required
            the designer to visit England. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather's projected trip to London in April 1911 apparently was canceled (Woodress
            211). However, Cather did travel to Boston for a few weeks in May and early
            June, in part to see Mrs. Annie Fields. Later in June she was in Maine, where
            she visited Mary Jewett, the sister of Sarah Orne Jewett, who had died two years
            earlier. By the end of June she was back at her desk in New York. According to
            Edith Lewis, Cather composed 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> during these few months
            (May through September) (76). Apparently, the novel had been accepted for
            publication in 
            <em>McClure's</em> before she left with her friend Isabelle McClung
            for Cherry Valley, New York, near Schenectady, on September. 
            <a href="hen10" id="hen10.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>In Cherry Valley, Cather may have revised her text for serial publication in
            
            <em>McClure's</em>; the novel, under the title 
            <em>Alexander's Masquerade</em>,
            would appear in three installments in 1912. 
            <a href="hen11" id="hen11.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Presumably, Cather kept at least one other
            copy of her typescript in order to submit it, or a revision of it, to editor
            Ferris Greenslet of Houghton Mifflin, in Boston. Houghton
            Mifflin records show that the manuscript was received on 21 November
            1911 and that Greenslet recommended acceptance to the publishers the next day.
            His report characterized this work (as he said some reviewers had characterized
            
            <em>The Troll Garden</em>) as comparable to Wharton's fiction. He emphasized
            this point once more at the end of the report. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Greenslet summarized the plot of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> briefly but
            pointed out that it is the book's "least important part"; rather, the novel is
            distinguished by the "excellence of the workmanship, its remarkable
            perceptiveness, its actuality, and the spiritual sense of life that informs it."
            These are vague but strongly supportive statements. Greenslet was probably alert
            to the sensitivities of the publisher, for he noted that the illicit affair was
            "quite unobjectionably handled." By identifying a "spiritual sense of life" in
            the book he may have been anticipating some reluctance to accept the manuscript.
            He also observed that 
            <em>McClure's</em> was scheduled to publish the novel and
            that S. S. McClure was to write the advertising, so the book would be publicized
            at no cost to them. Greenslet added that, should it prove desirable, they could
            no doubt obtain the illustrations used in the magazine at a reasonable cost. 
         </p>
         
         <p>This ardent sponsorship of the book would be necessary, since Greenslet was
            essentially arguing that Houghton Mifflin take the book not for immediate profit (he
            estimated the novel might sell at
            best four thousand copies) but because Cather was a "promising" writer and "in
            every way a desirable connection for us." Greenslet was right, of course;
            Houghton Mifflin did eventually profit by the connection. In any case,
            the book was accepted for publication on 22 November 1911. Cather might have
            made further revisions between that time and when she signed the contract on 1
            December (see the Textual Essay), but she would have had very little time
            afterward, for the records indicate that the manuscript was ready for the
            printer by 6 December. 
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h4>The Influence of Place</h4>
         
         <p>The sources for and influences upon 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> are of several sorts: Cather's personal
            experiences, especially travels to London and the Continent, which brought her
            in contact with fascinating people and places; literary influences,
            including specific texts that might have served as models for her novel, as well
            as the literary techniques of those artists she had read and admired; and
            newsworthy events of national interest that played an instrumental role in the
            development of plot and character, the most notable of which was the collapse of
            the Quebec Bridge on 29 August 1907. All of these sources and
            influences can be clarified through reference to the historical or
            social context of the time, and Cather's intentions can be discerned through
            certain patterns of allusions. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Of all these possible influences on the composition of the novel, Cather publicly
            acknowledged only the first—that is, the people
            and places that so excited her when she traveled to London. The impressions her
            travels provided her, she confessed in "My First Novels," were ones she "tried
            to communicate on paper"; they were "genuine," she added, "but they were very
            shallow" (91). On her trip to London in 1909, largely through her association
            with 
            <em>McClure's</em> and her acquaintances with the drama critic and writer
            William Archer and the English publisher William Heinemann, she moved
            comfortably in established literary circles. Cather met Ford Madox Ford, H. G.
            Wells, John Galsworthy, and others. She sat in William Butler Yeats's box, along
            with Lady Gregory, to see Maire O'Neill in the London debut of John Millington
            Synge's notorious 
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em> (7 June 1909). No doubt
            her admittance to this social arena was both pleasing and somewhat dazzling, but
            apparently none of the luminaries she met served as prototypes for any
            characters in 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>. Some of her creations—Maurice
            Mainhall, for example—are probably composite pictures that borrowed
            features or mannerisms from her English acquaintances. Only one person provided
            her with a model for an important character in the book, and there is no
            evidence that Cather actually met her. That person was Maire O'Neill, who played
            Pegeen Mike in 
            <em>Playboy</em>, and about whom we will have more to say. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Places impressed Cather: 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> may be an external novel in
            the sense that she imported recollections of different scenes and places into
            the book and made them serve her artistic purposes. Many of those places appear to
            have only an
            incidental relation to the plot. Cather might identify with her created
            character, because she and Alexander shared a feeling that one's
            "potentialities" were not being lived out (13); this feeling is clear from her
            letter to Jewett and elsewhere. Like Alexander, Cather was keenly responsive to
            certain stimuli. However, those stimuli were qualitatively
            different—Alexander responds to people and events seen through the
            lens of lost youth, while Cather, by her own admission, felt exhilarated by a
            new social environment and the dazzle of the passing show. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather drew upon memories of scenes that had for her the vivid brilliance of
            newness. In much the same way that she combined in "Paul's Case" the
            recollection of a high school boy she had known in Pittsburgh with her own
            excited reaction to New York City, she gave to Alexander emotions she had
            herself experienced. 
            <a href="hen12" id="hen12.ref" class="footnote"></a>  However, for Alexander,
            Cather located the origins of those feelings not in stimulating and interesting
            people and places but in his desperate sense of lost youth and ardor. In this
            sense, 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> could have easily worn the same subtitle she
            gave to "Paul's Case," for it too is a "study in temperament"; but, as with the
            short story, the author's temperament, which gives an emotional color to the
            narrative, ought not be confused with Alexander's psychological condition. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Some parts of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> seem to have less to do with scene
            setting than with sightseeing. So far as the formal coherence of the novel or
            Alexander's emotional turmoil and indecision are concerned, the dialogue and events
            of these episodes could have
            happened anywhere. For Cather, however, these places were probably tinged with
            powerful emotional resonances. We can establish a catalog of the scenes that
            appear to derive principally from Cather's experience. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In chapter 1, Lucius Wilson's walk to the Alexander house on Brimmer Street
            retraces familiar territory, for Cather lived on nearby Chestnut Street when
            working on the Milmine manuscript. During her stay there she met, among others,
            Mrs. James T. (Annie) Fields and Sarah Orne Jewett, and the neighborhood had
            associations with a rich literary and intellectual environment. She describes
            some of those feelings in her essay "148 Charles St." 
            <a href="hen13" id="hen13.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Nearly all of chapter 2 focuses on the Duke of York's Theatre, where Hilda
            Burgoyne plays Peggy, a donkey girl, in the obviously Irish though fictional
            play 
            <em>Bog Lights</em>. Like Alexander, Cather was the beneficiary of her
            acquaintances and sat in Yeats's box at the opening of Synge's 
            <em>Playboy</em> at
            the Royal Court Theatre, where she saw Maire O'Neill. In the company of drama
            critic William Archer she saw Lady Gregory's 
            <em>The Rising of the Moon</em>, a
            one-act play that concludes with a fugitive singing the popular ballad of that
            name. 
            <a href="hen14" id="hen14.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>In chapter 3, Alexander walks from his hotel to locate Hilda's lodgings off
            Bedford Square; a few days later he walks along the Victoria Embankment, crosses
            the Thames on the Westminster Bridge, and watches the Houses of Parliament aglow
            with the color of sunset. In her 10 August 1902 travel letter for the
            
            <em>Nebraska State Journal</em>, Cather notes that she had found a comfortable hotel "almost under the dome" of St.
            Paul's Cathedral. "We
            came here," she wrote, "because we wanted to be within walking distance of the
            Tower, Old Bailey, and the Temple." She and Isabelle McClung typically began
            their walking tour of the city in the morning but would soon become diverted:
            one starts "to make pilgrimages in the orthodox fashion, but one ends by merely
            watching the procession with perplexity" (
            <em>World and the Parish</em> 2: 907). 
         </p>
         
         <p>In chapter 4, Hilda and Alexander recall their student days in Paris, including a
            particular walk to the Place Saint-Michel, and along the Rue Saint-Jacques. And
            there are vivid images of light, the scent of lilacs, and the tragic face of an
            old woman. Again, to the degree that it was not entirely invented, this
            recollection may have come from the 1902 trip; curiously, Cather did not write
            much about Paris for the 
            <em>Nebraska State Journal</em>, restricting herself to a
            travel letter about "Two Cemeteries in Paris" (
            <em>World and the Parish</em> 2:
            924–29). 
         </p>
         
         <p>In chapter 5, Cather renders with great detail Alexander's steamship trip to
            London—the high swells of an oily sea, the smell of damp woolens, the
            humidity that made his hair collect drops of moisture, and so forth. She divides
            her attention between descriptive passages of the voyage and an assessment of
            Alexander's vacillating and troubled state of mind. This scene could have been
            based on one of her trips abroad or a composite picture of different crossings. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Chapter 7 is given over almost entirely to Alexander and Hilda's carriage ride to
            Kew and Richmond and back into London. This is one of the most extensive travel-like
            scenes in the novel, and
            the reader's attention is divided between the lovers' conversation and a tour
            through London on a rare day of fine weather. Cather's description of London
            light here, as William Curtin observes in a footnote (
            <em>World and the
               Parish
            </em> 2: 912n), is reminiscent of a similar description in the travel
            letter "Kensington Studio." Cather remarked on the changing quality of light as
            one travels westward from the city along Piccadilly toward Kensington: "From
            Trafalgar westward the very color of the city changes; the grimy blackness of
            the smokeladen town grows to a splendid grey about the National Gallery and St.
            Martin-in-the-Fields, and from there the color runs gradually into a higher and
            higher key, into the glorious green of the parks and the bold white of the club
            houses along Piccadilly, and finally into the broad asphalts of Kensington that
            are covered, or rather dusted, with a yellow sand that catches the sunlight like
            gold powder" (
            <em>World and the Parish</em> 2: 912). 
            <a href="hen15" id="hen15.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather might have combined her own recollections with images evoked by a poem by
            Alfred Noyes. Toward the end of their carriage ride, Alexander observes: "How
            many street pianos there are about to-night! The fine weather must have thawed
            them out. We've had five miles of 'Il Trovatore' now. They always make me feel
            jaunty" (87). The reference to 
            <em>Il Trovatore</em> may have less to do with
            Verdi's opera by that name than it does with Noyes's popular poem "The Barrel
            Organ" (1904; see the Explanatory Notes). The weather, the time of year, the
            sunset light, the bustle and tramp of the crowd, and of course the music of street
            pianos have their analogues in Noyes's poem.
            Perhaps more important is the fact that London is characterized as the land of
            lost love where "dead dreams go." A London laborer, for example, "stares into
            the sunset where his April love is fled, / For he hears her softly
            singing and his lonely soul is led / Through the land where the dead dreams go"
            (Noyes 230). Not only does Alexander ask Hilda to sing for him in chapter 4, but
            his search, through her love, for his own dream of youth and expectancy is
            mirrored in this and other passages in the poem. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Other episodes might also have drawn upon Cather's recollections. In chapter 8,
            for example, Hugh MacConnell walks Hilda home from the theater on a foggy night.
            And Alexander's train trip to Quebec might have been informed by Cather's own
            recent (1911) journey to Portland, Maine; she would not have had to go to Canada
            to see "gray rocks and hills and meadows" (105), smell the "pine-scented air"
            (109), or view the crystal-clear sky, at any rate. This journey is principally
            devoted to dramatizing Alexander's unquiet mind and sense of personal
            indecision, but Alexander does imagine yet another trip to London (145). While
            glancing out the window to see a group of boys camped along a marsh, he recalls
            camping "on a sandbar in a Western river" during his youth (105–06).
            As has often been pointed out, this seems to be a reference both to Cather's
            story "The Enchanted Bluff " (1909) and to her own childhood in Nebraska (see
            Explanatory Notes). 
         </p>
         
         <p>The reasons for this summary of episodes that probably derived from Cather's experience
            are several. First, as already suggested, the
            author might have imported her own feelings and impressions of people and places
            into her narrative quite easily. Second, this early in her career, it was an
            article of faith with Cather that such sharp feelings were necessary for good
            writing. In a letter to her former student Norman Foerster (10 July 1910), she
            advised that excellent writing comes from close and engaged acquaintance with
            the things of this world, for that is what gives it an individual character. And
            in a letter written in Naples to her former teacher Alice E. D. Goudy (3 May 1908),
            she says that one ought to read the densely detailed
            histories of Tacitus and Seutonius in Italy because the details must have a
            physical reality and tangible character. However, those same impressions of her
            trips to London, Cather later came to believe, were thin and shallow, or as she
            put it in her preface, "youthful vanities and gaudy extravagances" (196). Third,
            one of the reasons why she might have come to deprecate her first novel has to
            do with the imported character of those impressions. The scenes and episodes
            instanced above are for the most part attached to the consciousness of Bartley
            Alexander, but he is too self-absorbed, on the one hand, and too jaded, on the
            other, to be an adequate register of the sorts of emotions Cather had
            experienced. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Episodes deriving from Cather's travels and the feelings associated with them
            constitute nearly a quarter of the book. Cather's own comments in "My First
            Novels" notwithstanding, a great deal of this novel is not set in the "drawing room,"
            nor does it deal with "smart and clever" people. Alexander and Hilda
            derive their most vital and engaging qualities from their rural backgrounds, and
            these same qualities are dramatized most effectively in scenes that
            reflect Cather's vivid and deeply felt memories in combination with
            their own passions and desires.

         <h4>The Influence of Events and People</h4>
         
         <p>Two principal events influenced the genesis of Cather's novel. The first was the collapse
            of the Quebec Bridge on 29 August 1907. Ever since John P. Hinz's 1950 essay
            "The Real Alexander's Bridge," critics have acknowledged that the collapse of
            Moorlock Bridge was based on an actual bridge disaster and that, at least in
            certain details, elements of the plot and the behavior of Bartley Alexander were
            patterned after the consulting engineer, Theodore Cooper. The second event was
            the emergence of the Irish National Theatre, which promoted a nationalistic
            aesthetic ideology and achieved a certain notoriety with the production of
            Synge's 
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em>, in which the prototype for Hilda
            Burgoyne appeared in the role of Pegeen Mike. Critics have largely ignored the
            importance of this influence. The relation of these events to specific
            passages in or aspects of the novel are dealt with in some detail in the
            Explanatory Notes. Here we will describe these influences as they bear
            upon the genesis of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The construction of the Quebec Bridge was newsworthy even before its collapse;
            the bridge was an emblem for the progressive era of scientific efficiency. If only
            symbolically, the catastrophe
            left progressive prospects in doubt; nearly eighty workers died, and the event
            triggered an exhaustive Canadian inquiry into the disaster. In 1906, in an
            article titled "Erection of the Quebec Bridge," 
            <em>Scientific American</em> had
            hailed the project as a prospective engineering triumph, and 
            <em>Canadian
               Magazine
            </em> ran a lengthy article by James Johnstone on the history of
            "Bridging the St. Lawrence." The undertaking was a matter of national pride for
            Canadians and Americans alike, for it was to be the longest cantilever bridge in
            the world and it was, for all intents and purposes, an American feat of
            engineering. The designers were Americans; the steel members for the bridge were
            manufactured by the Phoenixville Bridge Company of Pennsylvania; many of the
            welders, mechanics, and riveters were Americans. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Once complete, the Quebec Bridge would have been an eighteen-hundred-foot steel
            construction spanning the St. Lawrence River, exceeding in length by some ninety
            feet the then-longest cantilever, the Forth Bridge in Scotland. The original
            design for the bridge called for a span of sixteen hundred feet, but Theodore
            Cooper, the consulting engineer, recommended changing the design after the
            contract for construction had been drawn up. Thus, cost projections were
            modified; resulting design changes led to strain on the lower compression
            members and the bridge's collapse. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Newspaper coverage was extensive and sensational, rivaling the subsequent
            coverage of the sinking of the 
            <em>Titanic</em> in April 1912. The journalistic
            importance of the event is suggested by two front-page headlines printed side by side
            in the 
            <em>New York Times
               
            </em> on 30 August 1907: 
            <span class="smallcaps">MARS INHABITED, SAYS PROF. LOWELL"</span>
             
            <a href="hen16" id="hen16.ref" class="footnote"></a>  and, in larger bold type, 
            <span class="smallcaps">"BRIDGE
               FALLS DROWNING 80
            </span>." For the journalist, the Quebec Bridge collapse had all the
            ingredients of a newsworthy story —considerable loss of life, tragic
            technological miscalculation, the drama of an urgent telegram to cease work
            having been fatally delayed, and the fall from public esteem of a celebrated
            engineer. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Given the widespread publicity about the event, it is curious that only one
            reviewer of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> even mentions, and then only in passing,
            the Quebec Bridge calamity as a source. Surely contemporary readers could not
            have failed to notice the similarities, but perhaps the connection was so
            obvious that it did not require explanation. The parallels are so explicit that
            it seems clear Cather was not attempting to disguise the connection. However,
            there is no evidence that she was trying to exploit the notoriety of the
            subject, 
            <a href="hen17" id="hen17.ref" class="footnote"></a> and she insisted that hers was not an
            "industrial novel" of the muckraking sort. Although her story followed
            accurately the events leading up to the bridge collapse, the divergences from
            fact are the more interesting because they show that Cather adapted the
            historical event to her own artistic purposes. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Moorlock, like its prototype, was to be the longest cantilever bridge in the
            world. The cause of the collapse is also identical—too much stress on
            a lower compression member. The Moorlock Bridge, like the Quebec Bridge, "sank
            almost in a vertical line, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went" (114; see
            illustrations 18–21, esp. 21). Cather reduced the number of casualties
            only slightly. She writes that "by morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out
            of the river, but there were still twenty missing" (115); the 
            <em>New York Times
               
            </em> (30 August 1907) initially reported that eighty men had died, but that
            estimate was later lowered to seventy-five. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather changed the facts in some important ways. Although he was not the bridge's
            principal designer, Theodore Cooper, the consulting engineer, was the focus of
            most newspaper and magazine pieces about the disaster. In appearance and manner
            he was nothing like Bartley Alexander. He was sixty-eight years old at the time
            of the collapse; he had not been on the site of construction for more than two
            years prior to the accident; he was somewhat vain and arrogant; and, by his own
            admission, he was a frail and unhealthy man. 
            <a href="hen18" id="hen18.ref" class="footnote"></a> Alexander, by contrast, looks "as a tamer of rivers ought to
            look"—forty-three years old, over six feet tall, and "glowing with
            strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks" (10). He complains that he
            is being forced by the bridge commission to "build pretty well to the strain
            limit up there. They've crowded me too much on the cost" (62). Cooper, on the
            other hand, was at least complicitous in cost-cutting measures, and in fact
            boasted that the Quebec Bridge would be the "best and cheapest," a future model
            of bridge construction. 
            <a href="hen19" id="hen19.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>A fatal moment in Cather's plot involves the nondelivery of a telegram sent to
            Alexander apprising him of worries about the bridge and asking him to come at once.
            The first telegram does not
            reach him because he is with Hilda in his New York apartment and unavailable to
            receive it; a second reaches him the next day, too late to avert the
            catastrophe. In actuality, Cooper had been advised by Norman McLure (the man he
            had appointed to keep him informed about the construction project), first by
            telegram and then in person, that the lower chords of the bridge were shifting.
            After meeting with McLure on 29 August, Cooper sent a wire to the chief engineer
            advising them not to add more weight to the bridge until the condition of the
            compression members could be properly evaluated. Delivery of that telegram was
            delayed, perhaps obstructed, by a telegraph strike. Cooper at first said he
            ordered that work on the bridge be stopped immediately; later he modified those
            remarks, saying that, as consulting engineer, he lacked the authority to stop
            construction. In any event, apparently he made no plans to visit the site even
            after the danger became clear. 
         </p>
         
         <p>There are other changes to the facts. First, Cather says Alexander was the "Chief
            Engineer" (116) for the Moorlock Bridge project, but he was the designer, not an
            engineer. The chief engineer would be required to work on the construction site.
            Neither the designer of the Quebec Bridge, Paul Szlapka, nor the consulting
            engineer, Theodore Cooper, worked on-site. 
            <a href="hen20" id="hen20.ref" class="footnote"></a> Second,
            for dramatic purposes, Cather was likely drawn to the notion of the intertwined
            fates of the creator and the creation, but she altered facts in having her
            bridge builder die in the St. Lawrence River. Third, Alexander often complains about
            the pressures from the "commission" to build the
            bridge cheaply, but there was no such commission. The Quebec Bridge and Railway
            Company was in charge of the construction and oversight since the very beginning
            in 1900. From time to time work on the bridge was halted until the Canadian
            Parliament could appropriate additional funding for construction. 
         </p>
         
         <p>What seems clear is that the Quebec Bridge disaster was fundamental to the story
            Cather wished to tell from the very beginning. It seems equally clear that, in
            adjusting the facts of the event to suit her purposes, she meant the reader to
            be sympathetic to her bridge builder and, because he was to die on the Moorlock
            Bridge, perhaps even see him as a tragic figure. When Alexander learns of the
            shifting lower chords of the bridge he acts with concern and dispatch. He is the
            victim of the collapse rather than its haughty perpetrator. He is largely
            indifferent to his public reputation and material comfort; in fact, his success
            has given him the feeling of being "built alive into a social structure you
            don't care a rap about" (13). He is, in effect, a heroic character living in an
            unheroic time. 
            <a href="hen21" id="hen21.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Labor organizations, petty profit
            takers, social and charitable obligations, and, finally, desperate and, we are
            to assume, lesser men who cling to him in the river bring him down. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Nothing in the story of the Quebec Bridge catastrophe would have suggested
            several trips to London, however, or the title character's involvement with an
            Irish actress. Much of that dimension of the narrative came from an entirely different
            sort of event. Although Cather had seen the London debut of Synge's
            
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em> and a performance of Lady Gregory's
            
            <em>The Rising of the Moon</em> during her 1909 trip, that is all we know
            about Cather's personal acquaintance with the performances of the Irish National
            Theatre Company. 
            <a href="hen22" id="hen22.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The initial purpose of the company, which was established in 1903 but actually
            had its beginnings, under other names, a few years earlier, was to represent
            authentic Irish character and culture onstage. The actors and actresses were
            unpaid amateurs, often performing on makeshift stages and under difficult
            circumstances throughout the country. Thanks to the philanthropic support of a
            wealthy Englishwoman, Miss Annie Horniman, the company leased the Abbey Theatre
            in Dublin. Thereafter they were able to perform their plays in more favorable
            and professional conditions. Among the important members were George Moore, John
            Millington Synge, Lady Gregory, and William Butler Yeats, but the entire acting
            company was united in wishing to avoid caricature, to shun the "stage Irishman,"
            and to reclaim in dramatic form authentic Irish speech and folk culture. They
            also wished to avoid a self-conscious "literary taste," preferring to deal with
            common and local themes and to address directly the Irish people as the true
            standard of aesthetic judgment. There was some hope as well that the various
            community performances would help to unite Ireland and promote national
            independence. For a time there were divisive sentiments in the
            company—one group claimed that the dramas should serve largely
            political purposes, while the other approved of a literary nationalism but thought
            that artistic excellence
            was their primary concern. The drama of the Irish National Theatre was
            regionalist in character and nationalist in outlook at the same time that, in
            the minds of Yeats, Lady Gregory, and others, it aspired to the highest literary
            achievement.

         </p>
         
         <p>When the company first played in London in 1903, a handful of English critics,
            including drama critic William Archer, praised the performances. After Cather
            saw 
            <em>The Rising of the Moon</em> with Archer in 1909, they discussed the brief
            play's curious simplicity and strange appeal. This conversation apparently made
            a lasting impression on Cather, for she recalled it many years later in a letter
            to E. K. Brown (24 January 1947). She had been perplexed by the lack of drama in
            this short play. Archer explained that anything interesting on the stage is
            perforce dramatically interesting and belongs there. Cather was to recall that
            she had learned something important that evening. "All at once," writes James
            Woodress, Archer "had struck out a foolish platitude she had previously
            respected devotedly" (207). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Archer published an essay in 
            <em>McClure's</em> elaborating his ideas about modern
            drama only a few months later, "The New Drama and the New Theater" (November
            1909). In this relatively brief essay, he traces the dramatic inheritance of the
            nineteenth century, locating the primary cause for revolutionary change in the
            person of Henrik Ibsen. It was not merely Ibsen's realism but his "localism" and
            his "nationalism"—the unembarrassed attachment to a dramatic rendering of the familiar—that
            made him such an important figure. One of
            the beneficiaries of Ibsen's revolution was the Irish theater. For Archer,
            Ibsen's influence could not be underestimated, for it reenergized the
            drama and in England "meant a declaration of independence from France; just as
            the progress of American drama, from about 1900, has meant a declaration of
            independence from both France and England" (10). For Archer, London theatergoers
            were now forced to look to Dublin or Manchester or even New York for something
            new and important in the drama. He concludes his essay by recalling his visit to
            New York in 1907 and discovering this radical change: "[I] saw nothing but plays
            not only by American authors, but taking firm hold of modern American life,
            political, social, commercial, domestic, in the East and in the West, in the
            heart of civilization and on its frontiers" (14). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Her conversations with Archer and her reading of his essay might have had
            contradictory influences upon Cather. On the one hand, as Loretta
            Wasserman has argued, Archer was forthrightly urging her to remove to London; on
            the other hand, if she really took his artistic statements to heart, he was
            suggesting that to be an artist one must return to one's native materials. Synge
            had faced the same sort of decision; at Yeats's urging, he had left Paris and
            returned to Ireland, and he began to write about Irish peasant life in Mayo or
            on the Aran Isles. The success of 
            <em>Riders to the Sea</em> proved that Yeats was
            right, but the Irish reaction to 
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em> proved that
            he was notoriously right. 
         </p>
         
         <p>When 
            <em>Playboy</em> debuted in Dublin in 1907, many theatergoers were outraged,
            and the performances occasioned what are typically known as the "
            <em>Playboy
               
            </em> riots." Upset theatergoers objected loudly and sometimes violently to its
            supposed indecency, its coarse language, and its putative theme (parricide); the
            play depicted Irish life and character in ways that the more refined, or more
            insecure, Irishman or Irishwoman found scandalous. When the Irish National
            Theatre performed in the United States in the fall and winter of 1911–12,
            Irish Americans reacted similarly to 
            <em>Playboy</em> in several cities,
            including New York—hooting the players offstage, pelting them with
            rotten vegetables, and the like. 
            <a href="hen24" id="hen24.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The London audience was perplexed but not outraged by Synge's play. Whatever she
            might have thought about the play, Cather found Maire O'Neill, the woman who
            played Pegeen Mike, particularly interesting. Edith Lewis recalled that Cather
            thought O'Neill a "gifted young actress . . . whose beauty and engaging
            personality vividly impressed her" (68). Lewis was perhaps referring to
            O'Neill's "personality" as a dramatic presence, but it is possible that Cather
            actually met her. We do not know how much Cather knew about O'Neill's life,
            though Yeats or Lady Gregory could have given at least an anecdotal biography of
            her; the ways in which Cather presented the life and background of Hilda may be
            wholly invention or, as in the case of the Quebec Bridge story, deliberate
            alteration of the facts to fit her own fictional purposes. 
         </p>
         
         <p>We may note the differences. Hilda Burgoyne comes from an acting family; she is originally
            from rural Ireland, though she grew up in
            London; she keeps a "mite of a hut in Galway" (49); she sends money home to her
            sisters and her cousin Mike; the playwright Hugh MacConnell is in love with her;
            Alexander remembers her as a combination of the "homely and sensible" and the
            "utterly wild and daft" (30); she plays the donkey girl Peggy in the play 
            <em>Bog
               Lights
            </em>; and Maurice Mainhall says she has "the Irish voice" (24). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Maire O'Neill was actually named Molly Allgood; she changed her name because her
            sister Sara Allgood was an actress in the same company. However, O'Neill did not
            come from Galway or from an acting family: her parents were working-class
            Dubliners. She never studied in Paris, but she became famous in the role of
            Pegeen Mike in 
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em>. She was engaged to John
            Millington Synge, more than twelve years her elder, until his death in early
            1909, only a few months before Cather saw her perform in London. Perhaps O'Neill
            recognized that her dramatic success was largely due to her Irish voice. "In
            dialect she is the one poetical actress our movement has produced," wrote Yeats
            (654–55). 
         </p>
         
         <p>These two events—the Quebec Bridge disaster and the dramatic
            experiments of the Irish National Theatre Company—were important
            influences upon Cather's novel. The first Cather knew largely through
            newspaper accounts; the second had more personal associations. The highly
            publicized bridge collapse helped shape her plot; Abbey Theatre nationalism and
            her interest in Maire O'Neill also contributed to the book. Together, the events epitomized
            the seemingly irreconcilable
            claims of art and life that characterized so much of Cather's fiction prior to
            the publication of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>. 
            <a href="hen25" id="hen25.ref" class="footnote"></a> The
            oppositions suggested by a successful engineer from the American West and a
            successful Galway actress were familiar to Cather, but her novel was to deal
            with this theme far more ambitiously than she had ever attempted before. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Bartley Alexander's problem, or one of his problems, is that he is a public man.
            Alexander is building the largest cantilever bridge in the world; he is
            internationally famous; he is the desired guest or speaker at important
            gatherings. He is, for both Lucius Wilson and Winifred Alexander, the one who is
            building "bridges into the future, over which the feet of every one of us will
            go" (18). It seems that Alexander has succeeded mightily. But Cather also
            portrays a second self, an unlived potentiality that refuses to die. In fact, as
            Alexander complains, this other self "is fighting for his life at the cost of
            mine" (130). But Cather never lets the reader know what sort of self or
            aspiration has been denied in him or to what degree his present life is a
            diminished thing. We know that Alexander studied at the Ècole des
            Beaux-Arts, but we do not know what he was studying. Presumably he was studying
            architecture, but if one wanted to learn how to build bridges it would have been
            better to go to Scotland than to Paris, and better still to join the U.S. Army
            Corps of Engineers, where so many bridge builders, Theodore Cooper included,
            trained. Alexander is something of an American Everyman, or at least the sort of man
            the "Sunday Supplement" men wanted for
            their newspaper articles—a restless, mechanical force, advancing a
            materialist, capitalist culture he neither understands nor
            desires. 
            <a href="hen26" id="hen26.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Hilda Burgoyne is a success story too. She has succeeded largely through the
            resources of her attractive personality and her charming Irish voice. If
            Alexander's life has become hollow and false, as 
            <em>McClure's</em> editorial
            staff apparently wished to emphasize by entitling the novel 
            <em>Alexander's
               Masquerade
            </em>, Hilda's success derives from her straightforward
            authenticity. She is very much the "fairy child" who has entered the garden
            walls, but her primitive energy has not been enervated by the trolls. "She's
            really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see," says Maurice Mainhall; she "makes
            the whole thing a fairy tale" (24). The plot and the feeling of 
            <em>Bog Lights
               
            </em> depend on "her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the
            shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, sometimes together, in
            her mirthful brown eyes" (25). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Without extratextual evidence, there is no way of knowing how, or in what order,
            Cather fused an engineering disaster and the story of a theater company's
            controversial triumph into a single narrative. What is more certain is that
            there is a tissue of oppositions in the book. The opposition of the practical
            world of bridge building to the artistic world of drama lends considerable
            weight to Susan Rosowski's observation that 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> is "an
            allegory about art in which Cather explored relationships among the creative
            energy of the artist, the spiritual world, and the physical one" (35). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Some of these oppositions are straightforward. The Victoria and Albert
            embankments in London or the quays in Paris, built to control and tame the
            Thames and the Seine, are set against the strong St. Lawrence River or a
            meandering river with its sandy banks that Alexander recalls from his youth. The
            Elgin Marbles, testifying to the "lastingness of some things," are in the
            British Museum, but so is the mummy room, that "ultimate repository of
            mortality" (32) which so terrifies Alexander. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The allusive expression of some of these oppositions is more subtle. Note the
            songs Cather refers to. In chapter 4, Alexander asks Hilda to sing "The Harp
            that Once," one of Thomas Moore's songs from 
            <em>Irish Melodies</em>, which were
            intended to capture the Irish spirit and did in fact win sympathy for Irish
            nationalists. The song itself is a lament, for the harp "hangs as mute," "As if
            that soul were fled,— / So sleeps the pride of former days,
            / So glory's thrill is o'er." It is a song, in other words, of the loss of Irish
            soul as reflected in the loss of music or art. "The Rising of the
            Moon," the song that Hilda sings in 
            <em>Bog Lights</em> and which Lady Gregory
            used in her play by the same name, is not so benign as it might appear, or so
            poetic as some critics have thought. A celebration of Irish bravery in the
            rebellion of 1798, it was written several decades later by the nationalist John
            Keegan Casey while he was in prison. It is a military song, a call to arms and a
            chant for Irish freedom, whose lyrics include: "Death to every foe and traitor.
            Onward, strike the marching tune / And hurrah me boys for freedom, it's the
            rising of the moon" (Gregory n.p.). "The Cloak of Gaul" is playing when Alexander
            enters the theater to see the final act
            of 
            <em>Bog Lights</em>. The actual title of the song is "In the Garb of Old Gaul,"
            composed by a major in the Black Watch in 1748. It is also fiercely
            nationalistic and was often used later as a recruitment song: "No effeminate
            customs our sinews embrace, / No luxurious tables enervate our race; / Our
            loud-sounding pipe bears the true martial strain, / So do we the old Scottish
            valor retain" (Graham 112–13). These songs have nothing to do with
            bridge building or bridge builders, nor, given the martialism of the lyrics, do
            they lend a realistic element of Irish charm to the scene. Instead, they
            reflect Cather's musings on a native and local culture whose folkways
            and dialect are the stuff of art. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Just as the Irish National Theatre Company tried to do away with the stock Irish
            character, Cather particularly prided herself on her representation of the Swede
            in 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em> In "My First Novels" she wrote that her novel was "not
            only about Nebraska farmers, the farmers were Swedes! At that time, 1912, the
            Swede had never appeared on the printed page in this country except in broadly
            humorous sketches; and the humor was based on two peculiarities: his physical
            strength, and his inability to pronounce the letter 'j'. I had certainly good
            reason for supposing that the book I had written for myself would remain
            faithfully with me, and continue to be exclusively my property"
            (94–95). Cather may have been somewhat disingenuous in that last
            remark, since William Archer and her own experience had convinced her that a
            faithful rendering of the local was actually the future of a reinvigorated art. 
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h4>Literary Models</h4>
         
         <p>Since John Hinz's brief essay on the novel in 1950, several literary sources and
            influences for 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> have been nominated, but we
            are particularly interested in those influences that may have
            contributed in some measure to the genesis and composition of the book. This is
            an appropriate emphasis, because as Bernice Slote, James Woodress, and others
            have noted, after 
            <em>The Professor's House</em> (1925), 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge
               
            </em> is psychologically the most autobiographical of Cather's novels. Generally,
            these influences are of two sorts: those that contribute to the
            creation of character and psychological motives, and those that contribute to
            plot and narrative texture. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather herself confessed she was too much under the sway of Wharton and James
            when she wrote the novel, though her comments indicate the influence
            of a literary manner, not specific textual sources. Hinz briefly notes
            the Jamesian qualities in 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>: "The international
            flavor, the genteel drawing rooms, the Boston-London axis of the
            story, and above all the painstaking analysis of motive and dissection of
            character are manifestly Jamesian" (473). Bernice Slote nominates Anthony Bream
            in James's 
            <em>The Other House</em> as a possible model for Bartley Alexander and
            notes that Cather reviewed James's novel in 1896, but she also believes that it
            is wrong to describe the novel as "Jamesian" (xvii; see also viii n. 3). We
            might also surmise that James's "The Jolly Corner" (1908), with its emphasis on
            a dreaded and ghostly alter ego, had something to do with Alexander's
            psychology. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather's novel is filled with Whartonian ironies, such as the wet and illegible
            letter Alexander wrote but never mailed to Winifred announcing his love for
            Hilda, but which his wife takes as evidence of devotion to her, or his statement
            to Philip Horton that "Anything I do can be made public" (110). Tonally,
            Cather's ironies are seldom so wry or comically pungent as Wharton's, but
            perhaps Wharton's suggestion in 
            <em>The House of Mirth</em> (1905) that Lily Bart
            is psychologically pursued by the Furies has some parallel in Cather's novel.
            Both Cather and Wharton were interested in myth, and L. V. Jacks and Bernice
            Slote believe that the love triangle between Paris (also known as Alexander),
            his wife, Oenone, and Helen of Troy may have contributed to Cather's conception
            of the love triangle she was developing in the novel. James Woodress has
            reaffirmed those correspondences and added that Keats's 
            <em>Endymion</em> might
            have contributed to the moon imagery that Slote locates in Greek and Roman myth
            and in Cather's novel (220). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Elizabeth Ammons sees Cather working with a different sort of myth—"the
            energizing myth of American manhood, nationhood, and empire" (748). She
            instances an abundance of essays published in 
            <em>Scribner's</em>,
            
            <em>Harper's</em>, 
            <em>Century</em>, and, of course, 
            <em>McClure's</em> that
            celebrated engineers, and often bridge builders, as providing social and
            cultural background for the novel. To this list she adds the possible
            influences of Rudyard Kipling's "The Bridge Builders" (1894), Richard
            Harding Davis's 
            <em>Soldiers of Fortune</em> (1897), Harold Bell Wright's 
            <em>The
               Winning of Barbara Worth
            </em> (1911), and the personal and published example of that epitome of masculinity, Theodore
            Roosevelt. These
            essays and fictions, according to Ammons, indicate the "well-developed backdrop
            of literature and cultural mythology" associated with "conquest of the
            environment, expansion of Anglo hegemony, and veneration of the Wild masculine
            West" (754). However, according to Ammons, Cather undertook to "demythologize"
            this myth in much the same way that Viola Roseboro's story "The Mistaken Man"
            (1907) did. Ammons speculates that Roseboro's story of a bridge disaster
            provided the "spark" for Cather's novel: the bridge builder in "The Mistaken
            Man" also works reluctantly but uncomplainingly under cost-cutting pressures;

         <p>Marilee Lindemann has identified the influence of Frank Norris's
            
            <em>McTeague</em>, though not in regard to the "second self " that bedevils
            both McTeague and Alexander. And, though they are not literary sources per se,
            Lindemann argues that Cather may have been influenced in a negative or
            ambivalent way by the writings of Theodore Roosevelt and Jane Addams. E. K.
            Brown, while recognizing that Cather tempered the violent emotions found there,
            suggests that Robert Louis Stevenson's 
            <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> may have
            served as a source for her protagonist. However, Cather's fiction, both before
            and after the publication of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, is so saturated with the
            theme of a divided self that this line of inquiry can only generally be related
            to the process of composition of the novel. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Susan Rosowski has discerned traces of Wordsworth, Keats, and Tennyson's "The
            Lady of Shallott" in the novel, but she also notes that at points Cather drops
            her authorial persona and "experiments in the manner of the French symbolists,
            using language rich in synaesthesia to evoke a private mood in which the present
            moment hangs suspended" (37). As evidence for this quality she instances two
            richly descriptive passages, both deriving from Cather's experience in London.
            This is an especially rich vein of inquiry. Despite their incidental relation to
            plot or to character development, these passages often give energy and emotional
            color to the story out of proportion to the events they dramatize. This also
            helps to explain the patterned allusions that seem to disclose and underwrite an
            intellectual complex, a tension between the nationalistic art of "localism" of
            the Irish theater (suggested by passing references to songs whose titles were
            benign but whose lyrics were militant) and the august embodiment of a universal
            world culture (hence mention of the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum). T. S.
            Eliot, also influenced by French symbolism, developed an analogous
            technique at that time.

         <p>A final strand of literary influence may offer some clues about
            Cather's approach to her material. As has often been noted, Cather reviewed
            Kipling's volume of stories 
            <em>The Day's Work</em> (1898) in the 
            <em>Pittsburgh
               Leader
            </em> in February 1899. Of the writer in general, she said, "The world
            has been a great many centuries in evolving its present gigantic industries, but
            Mr. Kipling is the first man who has ever written of them seriously or sympathetically"
            (
            <em>World and the Parish</em> 2: 557). Kipling, she
            wrote, "finds energy the most wonderful and terrible and beautiful thing in the
            universe" and has made energy "the subject matter for art" (558). Included in
            
            <em>The Day's Work</em> was the story "The Bridge Builders," about an engineer
            building a bridge over the Ganges, a man who, in Cather's words, "built his life
            into the bridge" (558). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Readers of </p>
         <p>
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>
         </p>
         <p> were made to understand, largely through the
            comments of Cather's Jamesian ficelle, Lucius Wilson, that Alexander, too, had
            built his life into the Moorlock Bridge: 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="inline_quote">
               
               <p>"I'm sure I did you justice in the matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel
                  that there was a weak spot where someday strain would tell. Even after you began
                  to climb, I stood down in the crowd and watched you with—well not with
                  confidence. The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your
                  façade rose, the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from
                  top to bottom,"—he indicated its course in the air with his
                  forefinger,—"then a crash and clouds of dust." (12–13)
               </p>
               
            </span>
         </p>
         
         <p>The parallels between material stress (on the lower chord of the Moorlock Bridge)
            and psychological stress (the foundation of Alexander's being) imply the
            inevitable collapse of both. 
         </p>
         
         <p>As Merrill Skaggs points out, such locutions as a "crack zigzagging from top to
            bottom" suggest that Cather borrowed some of her inspiration from Poe,
            especially from "The Fall of the House of Usher." The passage quoted above, and others
            scattered throughout the novel, show how Cather meant to
            connect, symbolically, the fates of creator and creation. 
         </p>
         
         <p>For this reason, Hinz's brief identification of Ibsen's 
            <em>The Master Builder
               
            </em> as a literary model is provocative, even beyond the claims Hinz makes for
            it: "A great builder grows old reluctantly; he becomes infatuated with
            Hilda—the symbol of his loss; he plans one last triumphant work; he
            suffers a fall from his own great structure. . . . It is not at all unlikely
            that she unconsciously drew upon her earlier readings to lend her novel its
            pattern" (473–74). Hinz adds only that Cather wrote an essay on Ibsen
            for 
            <em>Hesperian</em> (1 November 1892). 
            <a href="hen28" id="hen28.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>There are other parallels between the two works, however. Halvard Solness, the
            master builder, has achieved greatly and unexpectedly. He was a poor boy from a
            rural village who rose to the top of his profession. Because he is largely
            self-taught he is not called an architect, but he has prospered through his own
            ambition, through the aid of circumstances and "luck" (what he rather
            mysteriously calls his supernatural "helpers" in the
            world). 
            <a href="hen29" id="hen29.ref" class="footnote"></a> Dogged by a vague fear that he will be
            dethroned by the younger generation, Solness sometimes thinks he is mad. He
            believes there is a "troll" inside him that has caused his good fortune but will
            also turn against him in time. For Hilda, the origin of Solness's problem is
            that he has a "sickly conscience": "I mean your conscience is
            feeble—too delicately built, as it were— hasn't strength to
            take a grip of things—to lift and bear what is heavy" (299). Solness
            is attracted to Hilda because she is youthful, an emissary from the younger generation
            he so fears. She is to be his
            "princess," and his future constructions will be castles in the air with "firm"
            foundations. 
            <a href="hen30" id="hen30.ref" class="footnote"></a> It is Hilda who says the master
            builder "cannot climb as high as he builds" (315); she urges him to climb the
            tower of a new house he has built for his wife. Solness, claiming he can no
            longer live without joy, climbs the scaffolding with expectant purpose in his
            life, but, becoming dizzy, falls to his death. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Ibsen's play provided Cather with an imaginative example of dramatic contrast
            between two different activities: the building of a bridge and a romantic
            involvement with a woman perhaps not so coincidentally named Hilda. Furthermore,
            details in Ibsen's play would have been suggestive to Cather: a builder
            wrestling with some internal "troll"; a man whose conscience is too weak for the
            burdens placed upon it; marriage to an elegant woman whose attachments to duty
            seem stronger than life with her husband; a spontaneous young woman who
            reanimates the joy within a successful man but drives him to destruction. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Indeed, Cather, through her acquaintance with William Archer, had a more tangible
            link to Ibsen's dramas than when she wrote her college essay on Ibsen. The only
            English translation of Ibsen's plays available to Cather was by William Archer
            and Edmund Gosse. Archer was among the earliest and most prolific of Ibsen's
            champions, translating Ibsen's complete works and writing many essays and books
            about the man. If Cather read 
            <em>The Master Builder</em> in the English edition
            of Ibsen's 
            <em>Collected Works</em> (1906–12), she might have also read Archer's introduction to the play. There she
            would have learned about
            the play's genesis and also about the originality of Ibsen's method and subject
            matter. Archer considered 
            <em>The Master Builder</em> the most autobiographical of
            Ibsen's works, 
            <a href="hen31" id="hen31.ref" class="footnote"></a> and one filled with symbolism. But
            he insisted that it was a mistake to think of the play as purely symbolic.
            "There is nothing in the play which has no meaning on the natural-psychological
            plane, and absolutely requires a symbolic interpretation to make it
            comprehensible," he wrote. "It is true that, in order to accept the action on
            what we may call the realistic level, we must suppose Solness to possess and to
            exercise, sometimes in spite of himself, and sometimes unconsciously, a
            considerable measure of hypnotic power. But the time is surely past when we
            could reckon hypnotism among 'supernatural' phenomena" (xxxii). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Whether or not Cather got them from Archer, these two critical observations are
            pertinent to 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>. The St. Lawrence River, the mummy room
            in the British Museum, the Moorlock Bridge, London—even Hilda and
            Alexander—exist in their own right, but they also function as symbols
            in a narrative that Ferris Greenslet, at least, thought was informed by a
            "spiritual sense of life." Perhaps this is why critics have been able to speak,
            by turns and in uncontradictory ways, about the novel as realistic,
            naturalistic, allegorical, or symbolist. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Archer's second point is also germane because, even as a youth, Alexander exerted
            a powerful mystery and energy. This is true not only for Professor Wilson but also
            for Alexander's schoolmates;
            not only for Winifred, who asks Wilson to explain the man by recalling his
            youth, but also for Hilda; not only for London colleagues but also for the
            Sunday Supplement journalists. If the audience does not accept Ibsen's
            investment in Solness of "hypnotic power," says Archer, the originality and
            spiritual power of 
            <em>The Master Builder</em> will simply disappear. One might
            say the same about Bartley Alexander. This helps to explain Wilson's final
            comment in the epilogue: "He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He
            belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at
            the best" (126). Ibsen's drama also helps to explain Wilson's comment about
            Alexander in the opening chapter. There, Wilson imagines himself an onlooker
            who, like the spectators at the end of 
            <em>The Master Builder</em>, anxiously
            watches the protagonist climb ever higher, with a foretaste of catastrophe. 
         </p>
         
         <p>If Cather had read 
            <em>The Master Builder</em> in the 1893 edition, she would have
            encountered an introduction where Archer made an analogous point. To demonstrate
            that this hypnotic quality was not at all incredible, he retold the story of
            Solness but relocated the play in England and made the builder a journalist.
            Archer would have shown Cather, in a brief way, how translatable Ibsen's story
            was. If this drama—this "soul history," to use Archer's
            phrase—could as easily be about a London journalist as a builder in
            Norway, could it not also be about a Boston engineer? 
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h4>Publication and Reception</h4>
         
         <p>As Ferris Greenslet noted in his reader's report, S. S. McClure had taken a
            personal hand in advertising the story in his magazine. In 
            <em>McClure's</em>,
            
            <em>Alexander's Masquerade</em> appeared in three installments with five
            illustrations by F. Graham Cootes; one illustration appeared on the cover of the
            magazine that contained the first installment. Marilee Lindemann finds this
            cover illustration "garish" and notes that it curiously pictures a seductive
            Hilda in the role of Peggy in 
            <em>Bog Lights</em>, thus misrepresenting the
            subject matter of the novel. All of the illustrations are somewhat romantic, but
            those in the text do emphasize Alexander instead of Hilda. Lindemann believes
            the cover painting "tries to place Cather's story within the conventional
            framework of the adultery novel" (xiv). 
         </p>
         
         <p>The illustration does suggest a certain eroticism (Hilda is barefoot and
            seductively looking up at the audience), but if McClure superintended the
            illustrations he might have had something more calculating in mind. To the
            degree that the painting is reminiscent of 
            <em>Playboy of the Western World</em>,
            he might have been trying to capitalize on the recent notoriety of Synge's play
            and the U.S. tour of the Irish National Theatre Company. In the 
            <em>New York
               Times
            </em> alone, twenty-three articles appeared between October 1911 and
            January 1912 on the "
            <em>Playboy</em> riots" and attendant circumstances. Yeats
            and Moncure Conway published defenses of the play, and Lady Gregory rather
            shrewdly and dramatically had Theodore Roosevelt attend the play as her personal
            guest. Most of the detractors, on the other hand, thought the play was indecent and
            an offense to
            Irish morality and character. From the cover illustration, the unsuspecting
            reader might have anticipated an altogether different sort of story than the one
            Cather wrote, but it would have generated interest in the story nonetheless. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Greenslet's original suggestion that the publisher might use the illustrations in
            
            <em>McClure's</em> was abandoned, except that one was reprinted on the dust
            jacket above the publisher's description of the novel. In a sense, this
            publisher's blurb was the first review of the novel. Several of the phrases
            Greenslet had used in his original reader's report are repeated there. Not only
            does the description emphasize the resemblance to Wharton's fiction, but it uses
            such phrases as "dramatic, powerful, and haunting to the memory" and "marked ... by
            
            the qualities of distinction, of excellence of workmanship, perceptiveness,
            actuality, and the spiritual sense of life." 
         </p>
         
         <p>The reviews were generally favorable and tended to repeat the views, and
            sometimes the same language, that the publisher had advanced in its
            announcement—that it was an important first novel, reminiscent of
            Wharton, and that it demonstrated commendable craft and emotional restraint. The
            reviewer for 
            <em>Living Age</em> wrote, "Willa S. Cather has given the world an
            exceedingly finished piece of work, and a story which haunts the memory," and
            observed that, though its theme was intense, the author handled it with
            "refinement and distinction": "there is no hint of sordidness, and the pathos is
            never unrestrained" (192). A reviewer for 
            <em>Current</em>
            
            <em>Literature</em>
            detected "great artistic skill" in the book, "brilliant in its
            reflections of character and life, and admirably restrained and
            graceful in form and diction" (338). 
         </p>
         
         <p>A writer for the 
            <em>New York Times Book Review</em> characterized the book in much
            the same way that Cather herself would in "My First Novels": "There are dramatic
            situations, much clever conversation, and some graphic description. Miss Cather
            has a faculty . . . of catching and describing in terse, refined phrase the
            salient features of personality, both mental and physical" (295). An
            
            <em>Athenæum</em> reviewer for the British edition of the novel was
            much more succinct; the novel was "interesting" and the story was told with
            "some force" (217). Only the reviewer in the 
            <em>Independent</em> was dismissive,
            saying, "We sometimes doubt whether it is a compliment after all to be likened
            in literary style to Mrs. Wharton." While there is some feeling in the story,
            the reviewer thought that, "as a novel, it all seems rather futile" (47). 
         </p>
         
         <p>The review in 
            <em>Current Literature</em> summarized newspaper comments on the
            novel before offering its own opinion, noting that the 
            <em>Louisville
               Courier-Journal
            </em> had called it a "portrait group . . . in which the
            personages are presented with such intensity, with such feeling for character,
            as to make the canvas lose a moment its static quality, the figures seem but
            caught a moment in the scene of a drama" (337). The 
            <em>Providence Journal
               
            </em> commented that "only readers as finely sensitive as the author will
            appreciate it"; and the 
            <em>New York World</em> praised its compact energy and
            grace and thought it might instruct other novelists in the "power and
            blessedness of simplicity" (337). The reviewer then observed that the story was loosely
            based on
            the Quebec Bridge disaster but praised the author's "individualism and her
            determination to use social and industrial conditions for her own purposes as an
            artist" (338). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Only two of the reviews of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> were signed. Margaret
            Sherwood, whose novels were also published by Houghton Mifflin, wrote
            a lengthy review essay for 
            <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> entitled "Some Recent
            Fiction." The essay begins with a lament that modern fiction is overburdened
            with complexities. She regrets the loss of the ballad's power and simplicity,
            and, in a remark prefiguring the most famous phrase in Cather's essay "The Novel
            Démeublé," writes, "As much by what is left unsaid as by
            what is said, the imagination is set stirring" (680). Sherwood has relatively
            little to say about Cather's novel, but what she does say is wholly
            complimentary: "One finds in 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> a welcome contrast to the
            over-emotional tales. . . . [T]here is a steady and harmonious development of
            plot and character, a dignity and reticence in the treatment of the dramatic
            scenes. The author's workmanship is deft and skillful, and the swift, clean
            stroke tells on every page" (683).

         <p>H. L. Mencken's review is more surly and robust. In the present day, Mencken
            says, there are two schools of fiction— "The School of Plot and the
            School of Piffle" (156). But Cather as an artist has the intelligence
            to "aim higher," and 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> proves to be a "very promising
            piece of writing" (156). If she has chosen to follow Wharton, there are worse choices
            she might have made, for Wharton at least is an artist. Mencken
            commends Cather's style, her dialogue, and her pictures of "the cold Winifred"
            and the "alluring Hilda." Her treatment of Alexander, too, is good, or at least
            good enough, but by having him drown at the end Cather evades the problem of the
            book and sidesteps the realism of the situation. The average man, says Mencken,
            would have let the situation "drift" and settled into a complacent role as lover
            of two women separated by an ocean. 
         </p>
         
         <p>It is probably true that the first novel by any writer not content to write
            formula fiction is, in a way, experimental. Certainly, Cather's diverse
            materials and literary models indicate her ambition. It is probably true, as
            well, that looking back upon that first novel, with the full confidence of an
            achieved mastery of one's craft, Cather felt a twinge of embarrassment about her
            beginnings. Nevertheless, the novel went through five printings, and she agreed
            to write a preface for the 1922 reissue of the novel (albeit an apologetic one).
            Perhaps she liked the novel more than she was willing to admit. Later readers,
            at any rate, have been kinder to the book than she was. Edith Lewis reread it
            after Cather's death and was surprised at the intensity of feeling in it. E. K.
            Brown, Bernice Slote, James Woodress, and others have recognized its limitations
            but have admired it still. Marilee Lindemann has called it a "minor 'classic"'
            (vii). 
         </p>
         
         <p>To the extent that the novel represents the unavoidable and tentative first step
            toward Cather's later works, its significance ought not be undervalued. In her
            1922 preface to 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, Cather herself promoted the belief that a belated
            obedience to Sarah Orne Jewett's advice prompted her return to the "home
            pasture" and the creation of 
            <em>O Pioneers!</em>: "Of course, one day you will
            write about your own country. In the meantime, get all you can" (vii). Whether
            or not Jewett pointed the way for Cather's artistic development, what Cather got
            from the world at large was not merely a congeries of literary techniques and a
            rather artificial sophistication. Her literary aspirations were high ones.
            James, Wharton, the symbolists, Ibsen, Synge—these were literary
            examples of a rare order. And in a sense their examples, as artists, were the
            same. Henry James truly was a world citizen; he was born in New York, but he
            claimed his earliest memory was of the Place de Vendôme in Paris. But,
            by 1904, even James had come home to take stock of his native land, publishing
            
            <em>The American Scene</em> in 1907. It was James, too, after reading
            Wharton's 
            <em>The Valley of Indecision</em>, a novel set in eighteenth-century
            Italy, who believed Wharton should be "tethered in native pastures" and advised
            that she take up her "American subject," and "
            <em>Do New York!</em>" (Edel 580).
            The result was 
            <em>The House of Mirth</em>. Ibsen and Synge had lived and studied
            in the cultural capitals of Europe, but they too came home, to Christiania,
            Norway, or the Aran Isles of Ireland, for imaginative sustenance and a subject
            matter that truly belonged to them. The lives of the writers Cather deeply
            admired told the same story. 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> was an ambitious
            experiment which moved her that much more quickly and securely into her own
            literary territory, not because she was reacting against that first novel but because
            it set in motion imaginative
            energies that would eventually take her there.

      <h4>Preface, 1922</h4>
      
      <p>It is difficult to comply with the publisher's request that I write a preface for
         this new edition of an early book. "Alexander's Bridge" was my first novel, and
         does not deal with the kind of subject-matter in which I now find myself most at
         home. The people and the places of the story interested me intensely at the time
         when it was written, because they were new to me and were in themselves
         attractive. "Alexander's Bridge" was written in 1911, and "O Pioneers!" the
         following year. The difference in quality in the two books is an illustration of
         the fact that it is not always easy for the inexperienced writer to distinguish
         between his own material and that which he would like to make his own.
         Everything is new to the young writer, and everything seems equally personal.
         That which is outside his deepest experience, which he observes and studies,
         often seems more vital than that which he knows well, because he regards it with
         all the excitement of discovery. The things he knows best he takes for granted,
         since he is not continually thrilled by new discoveries about them. They lie at the
         bottom of his consciousness, whether he is aware of it or
         no, and they continue to feed him, but they do not stimulate him. 
      </p>
      
      <p>There is a time in a writer's development when his "life line" and the line of
         his personal endeavor meet. This may come early or late, but after it occurs his
         work is never quite the same. After he has once or twice done a story that
         formed itself, inevitably, in his mind, he will not often turn back to the
         building of external stories again. The inner feeling produces for him a deeper
         excitement than the thrill of novelty or the glitter of the passing show. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The writer, at the beginning of his career, is often more interested in his
         discoveries about his art than in the homely truths which have been about him
         from his cradle. He is likely to feel that writing is one of the most important
         things, if not the most important thing, in the world, and that what he learns
         about it is his one really precious possession. He understands, of course, that
         he must know a great deal about life, but he thinks this knowledge is something
         he can get by going out to look for it, as one goes to a theatre. Perhaps it is
         just as well for him to believe this until he has acquired a little facility and
         strength of hand; to work through his youthful vanities and gaudy extravagances
         before he comes to deal with the material that is truly his own. One of the few
         really helpful words I ever heard from an older writer, I had from Sarah Orne
         Jewett when she said to me: "Of course, one day you will write about your own
         country. In the meantime, get all you can. One must know the world 
         <em>so well</em> before one can know the
         parish." 
      </p>
      
      <p>There have been notable and beautiful exceptions, but I think usually the young
         writer must have his affair with the external material he covets; must imitate
         and strive to follow the masters he most admires, until he finds he is starving
         for reality and cannot make this go any longer. Then he learns that it is not
         the adventure he sought, but the adventure that sought him, which has made the
         enduring mark upon him. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When a writer once begins to work with his own material, he realizes that, no
         matter what his literary excursions may have been, he has been working with it
         from the beginning— by living it. With this material he is another
         writer. He has less and less power of choice about the moulding of it. It seems
         to be there of itself, already moulded. If he tries to meddle with its vague
         outline, to twist it into some categorical shape, above all if he tries to adapt
         or modify its mood, he destroys its value. In working with this material he
         finds that he need have little to do with literary devices; he comes to depend
         more and more on something else—the thing by which our feet find the
         road home on a dark night, accounting of themselves for roots and stones which
         we had never noticed by day. This guide is not always with him, of course. He
         loses it and wanders. But when it is with him it corresponds to what Mr. Bergson
         calls the wisdom of intuition as opposed to that of intellect. With this to
         shape his course, a writer contrives and connives only as regards mechanical details,
         and questions of effective presentation, always debatable. About the
         essential matter of his story he cannot argue this way or that; he has seen it,
         has been enlightened about it in flashes that are as unreasoning,
         often as unreasonable, as life itself.

         <h4>Textual Essay</h4>
         
         
         <p>This eighth volume of the Cather Edition presents a critical text of Willa
            Cather's first novel, 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, published in April 1912 by
            Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. A magazine version of the novel,
            titled 
            <em>Alexander's Masquerade</em>, was published in three installments in
            
            <em>McClure's Magazine</em> in February, March, and April 1912. The first
            British edition, titled 
            <em>Alexander's Bridges</em>, was published in London by
            Heinemann in August of the same year. A "new" Houghton Mifflin edition
            appeared in 1922; this included a preface by Cather. The book was part of volume
            3 of the Autograph Edition of Cather's fiction, which appeared in 1937. No other
            edition in English was published during Cather's lifetime, nor have manuscripts,
            proofs, or other materials antedating or contemporary with these texts been
            located. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The editorial procedure of the Cather Edition is guided by the protocols of the
            Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions. We begin with a
            bibliographical survey of the history of the text, sorting out any problems it
            may present. Making a calendar of extant texts, we collect and examine examples of
            all texts published during Cather's lifetime,
            identifying those forms that may be authorial (i.e., that involved or may have
            involved Cather's participation or intervention). These forms are collated
            against a base text serving as a standard of collation. 
            <a href="tcn1" id="tcn1.ref" class="footnote"></a> The collations provide lists of substantive and accidental variations
            among these forms. 
            <a href="tcn2" id="tcn2.ref" class="footnote"></a> A conflation, constructed from
            the collations, then provides us with a list of variant readings in all relevant
            (authoritative) editions. After an analysis of this conflation, we
            choose a copy-text and prepare a critical text. The collations and their
            conflation also provide the materials for an emendations list, which
            identifies changes the editors have made in the setting copy, and for a list of
            significant variants in authoritative editions that were not included in the
            list of emendations. In a separate procedure, we make a list of end-hyphenated
            compounds with their proper resolution. 
            <a href="tcn3" id="tcn3.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>This essay includes discussions of the composition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge
               
            </em> and of the production and printing history of the text during Cather's
            lifetime, an analysis of the changes made in the text during this period, a
            rationale for the choice of text for this edition, and a statement of the policy
            under which emendations have been introduced. All page and line references are

         <h4>Composition, Production, and Printing History</h4>
         
         <p>Cather apparently wrote most of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> during 1911; in that 
            year she also had surgery for a mastoid infection, which required several weeks of
            recuperation;
            spent approximately a month on 
            <em>McClure's Magazine</em> business in London and 
            another week visiting Mrs. James T. Fields in Boston; and worked again at 
            <em>McClure's</em> 
            for the three months preceding September 28. She then took a six-month leave from
            the magazine
            and, with Isabelle McClung, rented a house for three months in Cherry Valley,
            west of Schenectady, New York. Here she worked on revisions for the magazine
            text of her novel, which one source reports she had sent to 
            <em>McClure's
               
            </em> from St. Louis under the pseudonym "Miss Fanny Cadwallader." 
            <a href="tcn4" id="tcn4.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Cather customarily wrote the first drafts of her novels in longhand, then
            prepared or had prepared one or more typescripts, revising each as she went
            along. 
            <a href="tcn5" id="tcn5.ref" class="footnote"></a> Although no manuscripts or typescripts of
            
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> are known to have survived, we have every reason
            to believe that she followed this procedure with her first novel. Presumably,
            one copy of the final typescript went to 
            <em>McClure's</em> for the magazine
            edition, and Cather retained another copy, which she revised fairly extensively
            before sending it (or a retyped copy of it) to Houghton Mifflin.
            Ferris Greenslet wrote the reader's report, dated 21 November 1911, noting that
            the manuscript "comes to us as the result of many solicitations" and remarking
            on the "likeness" of the work to that of Edith Wharton. After summarizing the
            plot, Greenslet says that the novel is remarkable for "the excellence of the
            workmanship, its remarkable perceptiveness, its actuality, and the spiritual
            sense of life that informs it." He expects a modest sale of three or four thousand
            copies, 
            but adds that Cather will be "in every way a very desirable connection for us." 
            The contract, dated 1 December 1911, provided for a 10 percent royalty on the first
            3,000 
            copies sold at trade-list retail, escalating to 15 percent on copies sold above 5,000.

         </p>
         
         <p>The 
            <em>McClure's Magazine</em> installments are of roughly equal length, the last
            one only slightly shorter than the first two. Part 1 in the magazine (pp.
            384–95) includes chapters 1–3 of the novel; part 2 (pp.
            523–36) includes chapters 4–7; part 3 (pp. 659–68)
            includes chapters 8–10 and the Epilogue. Illustrations by F. Graham
            Cootes appear on pp. 384, 524–25, 527, and 658. They are full-page
            except for the one on pp. 524–25, which is double-page. Quotations (in
            caps) key them to the text as follows: 
         </p>
         
         <p>384: "Alexander switched on the lights and stood in the archway, glowing with
            strength and cordiality" (10.5–7, altered). The illustration shows a
            distinctly fortyish Alexander in an arched doorway, his tall wife to his left,
            both looking at Lucius Wilson, who appears to be rising from his chair. A bowl
            of roses on a table occupies the foreground. (Used on p. 11 of the first British
            edition.) 
         </p>
         
         <p>524–25: "Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles
            and broke into a low, happy laugh. 'How jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you
            remember that first walk we took together in Paris?"' (52.8–11). The
            center of the table divides the composition: Bartley on the right, looking at
            Hilda animatedly; Hilda on the left, looking away from him with a much more
            serious expression. (Used on p. 73 of the first British edition.) 
         </p>
         
         <p>527: " 'Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?"'
            (56.18–19). This illustration accurately depicts the scene described
            in the text. (Used as the frontispiece to the first British edition.) 
         </p>
         
         <p>658: " 'I thought I had to see you. That's all. Good-night; I'm going now.' She
            turned and her hand closed on the doorknob" (97.7–9, slightly
            altered). The illustration shows Hilda, hand on the knob of the door, looking
            sad; Alexander has her arm, as if about to stop her. The effects of the wet
            weather, prominent in the text, are not depicted. (Used on p. 139 of the first
            British edition.) 
         </p>
         
         <p>The first edition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> in book form was published on 20
            April 1912. 
            <a href="tcn7" id="tcn7.ref" class="footnote"></a> Crane reports that a preliminary dummy was
            ordered on 19 December 1911, that the composition order was placed at the
            Riverside Press on 28 December, and that printing was authorized 3 January 1912.
            Complete proof was sent to Cather on 30 January 1912, and two copies of the
            finished book were sent to secure British copyright on 25 March (23). This
            information is confirmed by Houghton Mifflin estimate cards and
            production records. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Crane records two issues of the first edition. In what she calls the "first
            issue," the half title appears on p. i, p. ii is blank, the title page is p.
            iii, and the copyright notice appears on p. iv. In the "second issue," the title
            page is p. i, copyright information appears on p. ii, the half title is on p.
            iii, and p. iv is blank. Crane argues that, although the rearrangement of the
            preliminaries "may have occurred in the second pressrun from the standing
            plates," the rarity of copies of the first issue "indicates that the change was made
            earlier in the first run, probably a
            stop-press correction" (23). 
            <a href="tcn8" id="tcn8.ref" class="footnote"></a> Crane seems to conclude that
            what she calls the first issue precedes the second because the Library of
            Congress deposit copy has the normal arrangement of preliminaries and would
            presumably have been an early copy, and because there are many more extant
            copies of the book with the abnormal arrangement of preliminaries than with the
            normal one. 
         </p>
         
         <p>However, it is difficult to understand why a printer would have ordered a
            stop-press correction involving the reimposition of plates for no other reason
            than to change the usual arrangement of preliminaries to an anomalous
            one—the half title, by convention, precedes the title. Frederick B.
            Adams suggests that the change might have been made for "esthetic" reasons, in
            order to have a blank page facing the first page of text (103–04).
            Adams had previously stated, basing his argument on the Library of Congress
            deposit copy and on the paucity of copies of the book with the normal
            arrangement of preliminaries, "that the correct order of preliminaries
            represents a true first issue, and that the incorrect order is characteristic of
            all later issues," adding that he could not say "by what freak of production so
            extraordinary a situation could exist" (99). 
         </p>
         
         <p>We think it equally possible that Crane's "first issue" was the second (showing
            the half title in its customary position preceding the title) and that what she
            calls the "second issue" was the first (showing the half title following the
            title). As Herbert Johnson notes, it was not uncommon for an imposition error to persist
            through most of the copies printed, and advance copies (and
            presumably copyright copies) were always made up of the corrected
            sheets. 
            <a href="tcn9" id="tcn9.ref" class="footnote"></a> We also believe it more accurate to label
            Crane's two "issues" as states of a single issue. 
            <a href="tcn10" id="tcn10.ref" class="footnote"></a> In what follows we adopt that terminology. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Crane states that the book was "reissued by Houghton Mifflin in about
            1918 using surplus sheets of the original printing," priority of issue
            determinable only by differences in binding (22). 
            <a href="tcn11" id="tcn11.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            However, the production record card does not mention a reissue in 1918. If
            no changes were made to the signatures used, it is at least possible that no
            entry was made (though one would expect to see an entry to cover binding costs,
            and there is none), but we can find no other evidence of a printing or issue c.
            1918. At one point Crane states that "270 sets of the original sheets" were
            offered to Heinemann, which eventually decided to reset the text for the British
            edition (23). This cannot have been a c. 1918 reissue, however, because there
            would have been no reason to offer Heinemann copies of the U.S. edition after
            Heinemann had published its own (in 1912), unless one makes the unlikely
            assumption that the original British edition had been exhausted and Heinemann
            did not wish to reprint from its own plates. More likely, the new issue was the
            "small edition" (i.e., printing or issue) "which will tide us over for a few
            months" referred to by Ferris Greenslet, Cather's editor at Houghton
            Mifflin, in his 4 May 1922 letter to her. It had been printed, he
            said, while he was in Europe, which would date it between 23 January and 21
            April 1922. The Houghton Mifflin production card has an entry "X/4" dated 1/22, involving
            270 copies at $.215 per copy. "X" usually indicates a "correction" or "repair"
            order, and changes involving new plates were made in the copies mentioned below.
            The most likely assumption is that Houghton Mifflin made changes to
            the plates and either reprinted 270 copies or altered, bound, and reissued 270
            previously unbound sets of sheets of the first issue. The charge of $58.13 (c.
            270 x $.215) was for those changes and possibly for
            binding. 
            <a href="tcn12" id="tcn12.ref" class="footnote"></a> We think it more likely that this was
            a new printing, and treat it as such. 
         </p>
         
         <p>We have seen two copies, and have a description of another copy, of the book
            without date on title page, with conventionally arranged preliminaries, with
            colophon but without advertising leaves, and with "low" corrected to "blow" at
            55.10. A two-leaf fold is inserted in the last gathering, leading to a new
            collational formula. These copies are bound in blue mesh cloth with gilt
            stamping and lack the "S." in Cather's name on cover and spine. We believe they
            are copies of the January 1922 printing. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Crane says that, in all, the first edition comprised 5,270 copies, that the first
            impression was of 2,270 sheets (22, 23), and that there was a second printing of
            3,000 sets of sheets (23). Crane might have based the 5,270 figure on
            information provided her by Linda J. Rush, of Houghton Mifflin's
            contracts department, in a letter dated 31 March 1977, which specifies "a total
            printing of 5,270 copies." However, this number, as Herbert Johnson points out,
            is merely the sum of copies entered on the production record card, and clearly 
            refers to all copies of the book printed between 1912 and 1933. In a
            letter dated 1 May 2001, Ms. Jane LeCompte, corporate communications manager for
            Houghton Mifflin, reports from printing records "that the first
            printing was 2500 copies in March 1912," that "a new edition of 1000 copies was
            printed in 1922; 500 more were printed in 1925," and that "there was a re-issue,
            with a printing of 1000, in 1933." Crane gives no date for the "second printing"
            she lists; its size agrees with the figure obtained by subtracting 2,270 from
            the 5,270 figure she gives for the size of the first edition. We conclude that
            there was no second printing of 3,000 copies from standing
            type. 
            <a href="tcn13" id="tcn13.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>What Houghton Mifflin called a second edition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge
               
            </em> was initiated in 1921. Greenslet wrote Cather on 27 October of that year: "I
            think that conditions are coming to a point where we can afford to reprint, but
            reprinting ought to be accompanied by some sort of reannouncement to restimulate
            interest in it." He suggested appending a long, uncollected short story, a
            proposal that came to nothing. He wrote again, on 21 April 1922, that the
            "reissue" was tentatively scheduled for the fall list and asked Cather if she
            would like to write a preface. She agreed, and sent the typescript to him in
            September; he acknowledged receiving it on 25 September. On 30 October Greenslet
            wrote to say that he was sending Cather two copies under separate cover; she
            wrote him on 11 November that she still had not received them. The date of
            publication entered on the Houghton Mifflin record card is 25 October
            1922, and the "New ed." is listed in the "Index to Fall Announcements" in 
            
            <em>Publishers' Weekly</em> for 23 September 1922: 1020. 
            Crane's date of January 1922 for publication is a slip (the preface
            itself is dated September 1922); the January printing was presumably the second
            printing of 270 sets of sheets discussed above. The "new edition" had three
            printings: 1,000 copies on 25 October 1922, 500 in July 1925, and 1,000 in June
            1933 (a Houghton Mifflin production record specifies the 1933 printing
            as consisting of 1,000 copies and dates it 21 June 1933). The list of Cather
            titles in the preliminaries of the 1922 printing ends with 
            <em>One of Ours
               
            </em> (September 1922), in the 1925 printing with 
            <em>A Lost Lady</em> (1923), and
            in the 1933 printing with 
            <em>Obscure Destinies</em> (1932). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Crane says that the text of the 1922 "edition" is "set from the original 1912
            plates to which is added the new front matter" (25) and notes that the error at
            55.10 ("low" for "blow") is corrected. If this text was indeed reset from a copy
            of the first edition or from the plates of the first edition, the 1922 edition
            is a true edition. If, however, the 1922 printing was made from the 1912 plates
            with a preface added, it is bibliographically another printing of the first
            edition; the addition of new preliminary materials does not in itself constitute
            a new edition, since it does not affect the text of the novel. Careful
            examination of several copies confirms that the 1922 "edition" text was printed
            from plates of the 1912 edition, not reset; following a common practice,
            Houghton Mifflin called the edition a "new" one because it added
            Cather's preface (it also changed the front matter and omitted the four pages 
            of advertisements at the end already deleted in the 1922 printing) and because a
            new copyright was secured. 
            <a href="tcn14" id="tcn14.ref" class="footnote"></a> Copies of "new
            edition" printings 2 and 3 bear no date on the title page but have "1912 and
            1922" on the copyright page. As noted above, they may be distinguished by the
            contents of the list of Cather novels included in the preliminary materials. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> formed part of volume 3 of the Autograph Edition of
            Cather's fiction, published in 1937. Scribner's had initiated the idea of a
            subscription edition as early as 1932, but Houghton Mifflin would not
            release the rights to the four early novels it had published (Lewis
            180–81; Greenslet to Cather, 1 July 1933; Knopf memoirs). When
            Houghton Mifflin took up the idea, Cather worked with Greenslet, her
            former editor there, and after some negotiation the edition was agreed
            to. 
            <a href="tcn15" id="tcn15.ref" class="footnote"></a> Cather wanted W. A. Dwiggins, who had
            designed some of her Knopf novels, as the designer, and she wanted the same type
            font that had been used in the Thistle Edition of Robert Louis Stevenson (Cather
            to Greenslet, 18 December 1936). Greenslet demurred (21 December 1936), and
            Bruce Rogers was engaged instead (Woodress 468). During 1936 Cather looked over
            the titles to be included and made changes, the number varying with the
            particular title. There are also blanket changes in the edition, due either to
            Cather's intervention or, more likely, to Houghton Mifflin house style
            or Rogers's design—changes Cather probably did not specify but to some
            of which she may have assented. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In summary, we suggest a simplification of Crane's account, with distinguishing
            points:

         <h4>Changes to the Text I: The Magazine Text (

         <p>Houghton Mifflin published the
            first book edition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> as soon as the third
            installment appeared in 
            <em>McClure's</em>, yet there are more than four hundred
            variants between the two texts, over 40 percent of them substantive. We believe
            that these substantive changes are authorial; they are not the sort of variants
            that results from an editor's hand, and they are typical of the kind of changes
            that Cather was to make over and over again in later novels. The variants usually
            affect a word or a
            phrase. When they involve a sentence or two, the typical change rearranges
            clauses or phrases, or adds to or deletes from the original version without
            recasting whole paragraphs. Cather does not reorganize her material or alter her
            conceptions of character or event; instead, she makes her diction more colorful
            or precise, eliminates the unnecessary or the redundant, clarifies pronoun
            reference, and improves the rhythm of a phrase or a sentence. Changes deleting
            material in the 
            <em>McClure's</em> text outnumber more than two to one changes
            amplifying such material. A substantial part of the Houghton Mifflin
            text is set line for line with the magazine text.

         <p>One sees in the frequency of these variants that Cather's tendency to regard the
            magazine versions of her novels as drafts that she would improve for the first
            editions in book form, but which she would not in most cases revise extensively
            thereafter, is evident in her very first novel. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Some 250 additional variants between these two texts involve accidentals. It is
            far from clear that Cather initiated all such changes. However, because she read
            the proofs of the 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i text, we believe she acceded to its accidentals, at least tacitly. For
            example, almost half the spelling variants change 
            <em>McClure's</em> "theater" to
            "theatre" (Alexander attends the theatre in London, not in the United States),
            some 70 percent of word-division variants change one-word contractions such as
            "didn't" to two-word contractions ("did n't"), and more than half the
            punctuation variants involve the addition or deletion of a comma (especially the
            addition of a comma to introductory phrases). These changes are often matters of
            house style, although it is possible that Cather made a blanket specification of
            the changes she wanted. The fifty-odd typographical changes may also have been
            made by the Houghton Mifflin copy editor. More than 80 percent of them
            add or delete a paragraph indentation, usually the former. These variants might
            have been authorial, but it is equally likely that they were not; for example, a
            great many of them mark new speech with a new paragraph, a practice that is more
            probably the result of house style than of a deliberate authorial request. 
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h4>Changes to the Text II:
            <span class="smallcaps"> HM</span>1.i and the Heinemann Edition
         </h4>
         
         <p> The first British edition of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> was printed by
            J. Miles &amp; Company and published by Heinemann in August 1912. Presumably
            set from a copy of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1, the text exhibits more than 250 variants from that of
            
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i, some 40 of them substantive. As is usual, many of the differences adapt
            U.S. style to British conventions: "apartment" is changed to "flat,"
            "greens" to "holly and mistletoe" or "holly" or "evergreens," "street clothes" to
            "outdoor clothes," "daft" to "crazy" or "wild," and
            "shades" to "blinds." 
            <a href="tcn16" id="tcn16.ref" class="footnote"></a> Other changes seem
            arbitrary: "elegant" to "graceful," "jolt" to "nuisance," "reliable" to
            "trustworthy." In some cases the Heinemann reading seems simply fussy: "poured"
            to "poured out," "wrote her" to "wrote to her," "converse" to "conversation,"
            "offset by" to "compensated for by." 
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the more than two hundred accidental variants, some 70 percent are accounted
            for by the change from "o" or "u" to "ou" in words such as "color" and
            "mustache," by the omission or addition of a comma, and by the change from
            two-word contractions to one-word contractions. "Every one" and similar
            compounds are set as one word, "gayly" is spelled "gaily," and words like
            "travel" have their final consonant doubled in past tense. 
         </p>
         
         <p>There is no external evidence that these variants were the result of Cather's
            intervention. Most of the accidental variants can be explained as the result of
            Heinemann's house style (especially the use of British spelling conventions),
            and most of the substantive changes could have been the result of the desire to
            clarify or "improve" readings that were thought inaccurate or unfamiliar to
            British readers. Moreover, none of the substantive variants (except the
            correction of "low" to "blow" at 55.10 and "sleeves" to "sleeve" at 77.23)
            appears in the Autograph Edition text. For these reasons, the Cather Edition
            does not consider the Heinemann edition authoritative, and its readings are
            omitted from the Table of Rejected Substantives. 
         </p>

         <p>No external evidence shows that these changes are authorial, nor is the internal
            evidence especially convincing. The first two Autograph Edition readings in the
            table are awkward, the third and fifth are unnecessary, and the fourth may be an
            error. "Sleeves" is an error in 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i that any copy editor should notice and
            correct, and the two variants following are unnecessary changes. "Was stopped"
            is grammatically parallel with "was driven" in its sentence, but this is the
            sort of fussy "improvement" that Cather generally disdained. The last Autograph
            Edition reading changes the meaning of the sentence, but the 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i reading is
            not incorrect. Cather might have specified these revisions, but they are
            insignificant in comparison with the changes she made to the magazine text for
            
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Although a marked copy of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1 was presumably setting copy for the Autograph Edition text,
            the accidental variants between the two
            texts number over three hundred. There is no external evidence that they are
            authorial: although Cather might have requested some classes of them or have
            agreed to the styling of the Autograph Edition, the evidence suggests that most
            if not all of the variants are the result of Houghton Mifflin's house
            style or of Bruce Rogers's design for the edition. For example, the use of
            single quotation marks instead of double to mark speech is characteristic of the
            edition as a whole, as is the following of British spelling: more than half the
            variants add the "u" to words such as "color," and another quarter change "gray"
            to "grey." Over 60 percent of word-division changes turn 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i's two-word
            contractions into one-word forms ("are n't" to "aren't," e.g.), and two-thirds
            of the variants in punctuation involve the addition or deletion of a comma. It
            is most unlikely that Cather would mark hundreds of specific changes in
            accidentals yet give only cursory attention to substantives.

         <h4>
            
            <em>The Choice of Copy-Text</em>
            
         </h4>
         
         <p> The general policy of the Cather Edition is to
            prefer the earliest edition of a text in book form to a later one, because the
            first printing of the first book edition usually best represents Cather's
            intention for her work at the time when it most fully engaged her imagination.
            No decision is made, however, until collations are done and their
            conflation analyzed; it is always possible that the existence of late
            proofs or other materials could lead to a different choice. In the case of 
            <em>
               Alexander's Bridge
            </em> there are only three possibilities: the magazine text,
            that of the first book edition, and that of the Autograph Edition. After a study
            of these texts, we have chosen to reprint a copy of the first trade printing of
            the first edition of the novel in book form (Houghton Mifflin, 1912),
            emended to correct three errors. 
            <a href="tcn17" id="tcn17.ref" class="footnote"></a> 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>We believe that Cather followed what became her usual practice in producing her
            first novel. That is, the 
            <em>McClure's</em> text was based on one typescript
            (ts1) and 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i either on a revised copy or carbon of ts1 or, possibly, on a
            retyped copy of this revision (ts2). Although it is likely that Cather made some
            changes on the Houghton Mifflin galleys, the differences between the
            
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span> and 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> texts seem too substantial and numerous to have resulted entirely from
            galley changes to identical setting copy. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Our experience with other Cather novels for which typescripts exist has convinced
            us that 
            <em>McClure's</em> house style and copyediting practices would have
            altered the accidentals of ts1, just as Houghton Mifflin's house style
            and copyediting practices altered those of the lost revision of the typescript
            which served as setting copy for 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i. That is, both 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> and 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i are, with
            respect to accidentals and typographical variants, "social" texts—the
            result in the first case of passive acquiescence in 
            <em>McClure's
               
            </em> copyediting, and in the second case of at least tacit collaboration between
            Cather and her publisher. 
            <a href="tcn18" id="tcn18.ref" class="footnote"></a> Neither text represents
            accurately or completely the accidentals of the typescript on which it was
            based. However, we believe that 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i comes closer to Cather's intention for her work than 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>, because Cather more actively participated in its
            preparation and because it is more typical of her work. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Although the text in 
            <em>McClure's</em> was published first, the evidence cited
            above, and confirmed by Cather's practice in other novels that first appeared in
            magazine form, indicates that Cather regarded the magazine versions of her
            fiction as essentially drafts to be polished. In the case of 
            <em>Alexander's
               Bridge
            </em>, the sheer number of substantive and accidental variants between
            
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> and 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i clearly supports this view. Moreover, once a novel appeared in book
            form, there are in most cases (
            <em>The Song of the Lark</em> is the obvious
            exception) comparatively few substantive variants in later texts. Finally,
            external evidence suggests that Cather was interested in the magazine versions
            of her work only as they provided income; she told Knopf on one occasion that
            she reacted negatively to the very idea of such publication but recognized its
            income potential and publicity value (Cather to Knopf, 22 November 1922). There
            is little indication that she took pains with any of the magazine texts of her
            fiction except for the 
            <em>Forum</em> text of 
            <em>Death Comes for the
               Archbishop
            </em>, of which corrected proof sheets exist for some chapters of
            book 1. On the other hand, there is ample evidence that she took great pains
            with the book versions. Edith Lewis, for example, notes that Cather "did not
            much like serial publication" (180) but insisted on seeing foundry proofs of her
            novels and asked Lewis herself to look at those proofs for 
            <em>Shadows on the
               Rock
            </em> in her absence (161). We also know that Cather read proof for
            
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i, but it is unlikely that she did so for 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <p>There are good reasons to prefer the 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i text in selecting both substantive and
            accidental variants—the substantives because they are clearly later,
            authorial readings representing Cather's final intention for her novel, the
            accidentals because the readings of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i not only received Cather's attention
            but better represent her usual practice in other novels, for example, in such
            frequent cases as the substitution of a comma plus dash for 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> comma, or the
            British spelling of "theatre" and "grey." The "theatre" reading is particularly
            interesting, because Houghton Mifflin's use of the British spelling
            reflects the international flavor of the book and Cather's
            sensitivity to cultural nuance. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Because 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i, alone of the authorial texts, is superior with respect to
            substantives and follows Cather's known practice with respect to accidentals
            better than 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>, we retain here a limited concept of copy-text. We have in the
            case of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> an example of "radiating" texts: 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> and 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>.i
            derive independently from a lost original. The earliest forms of the text
            (holograph versions and early typescripts) are lost. A late typescript, also
            lost, was copyedited at 
            <em>McClure's</em> and used as setting copy for 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>.
            Meanwhile, Cather continued to revise, quickly producing a later text that was
            used as setting copy for 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i. 
            <a href="tcn19" id="tcn19.ref" class="footnote"></a> The readings of
            
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span> are those of a magazine text Cather regarded merely as a source of additional
            income—little more than a draft to be further revised. The substantive
            readings of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM1</span>.i are later, authorial, and superior. Its accidental readings
            result from at least tacit collaboration between Cather and her copy editor (or publisher).
            
            We know that Cather read proof prior to publication, and in this case
            the 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i accidentals are far more characteristic of Cather's practice in later
            novels than are the readings of 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>. Thus, unless we find a nonsensical reading,
            some sort of error, or other evidence, there is no reason not to prefer the
            
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i readings over those of 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>. In dealing with other Cather novels we have
            made many more emendations than is the case here; in editing 
            <em>One of Ours</em>,
            for example, we emend dozens of accidentals as well as nearly twenty
            substantives. The resulting text of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> is essentially an
            emended edition of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i. It is a critical text in the sense that it was arrived
            at as the result of a series of editorial choices based on our belief that 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i
            derives from revisions to a lost typescript closer to Cather's intentions for
            her work than the "draft" version that served as setting copy for 
            <span class="smallcaps">MM</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In the case of the Autograph Edition text of 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, there are
            even fewer substantive variants than is the case for most other novels included
            in that edition. This suggests that Cather's attention to this novel was
            perfunctory. Most of the accidental variants, we believe, are the result of
            house or edition styling; it is possible that Cather made some of these changes
            or acceded to blanket changes, but there is no direct external evidence that she
            did so, and the internal evidence is unconvincing. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Moreover, the Autograph Edition had a context quite different from that of 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.
            It aimed to present the work of a well-established author to libraries and
            collectors, and it came twenty-five years after the first book edition, which
            had presented the reading public with a first novel by a relatively new author.
            Cather's engagement with her work in 1912, especially given her later
            disparaging remarks about 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em>, was obviously fuller; it
            is not surprising that she gave the Autograph Edition text so little attention.

         <h4>Emendation and Related Matters</h4>
         
         <p>The Cather Edition emends setting copy under the following 
            circumstances: (1) to correct a typographical error; (2) to
            change an accidental when it is clear from many other examples that a particular
            reading is anomalous—a slip or a rare exception; (3) to resolve
            inconsistencies in accidentals occurring in such close proximity as to distract
            a reader, provided that the prevailing practice of the text can be determined;
            (4) to correct a misspelling or supply the proper accent on a word in a foreign
            language; (5) to correct a substantive error or make a substantive change that
            Cather herself asked to have corrected or which can be reasonably inferred to be
            a change she requested; and (6) to correct a substantive error when it is clear
            from many other examples that a particular reading is a slip or a rare
            exception. 
            <a href="tcn20" id="tcn20.ref" class="footnote"></a> We do not emend to "improve" Cather's
            wording or grammar, to modernize her diction or usage or use of accidentals, to
            impose consistency where inconsistency is not obtrusive, to incorporate
            authorial revisions that do not belong to the period of Cather's fullest
            imaginative engagement with the work, or to correct errors that Cather herself
            did not address (except when a simple factual error can be corrected without
            further revising the text). 
         </p>
         
         <p>Houghton Mifflin set 
            <em>Alexander's Bridge</em> with some care. There
            are few compositorial errors in 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i, and little of the inconsistency in the
            treatment of accidentals that is obvious in, for example, 
            <em>One of Ours</em>. We
            emend "low" to "blow" at 55.10, "Mrs" to "Mrs." at 57.2, and "sleeves" to
            "sleeve" at 77.23, but we leave "good-by" at 98.5 as an acceptable form even
            though it is changed to "good-bye" in the Autograph Edition text. Although the
            Autograph Edition's "Hortons"' at 119.1 has merit, we leave "Horton's" because
            it also makes good sense. We make one class of typographical changes silently,
            setting in roman type all italicized punctuation marks that follow italicized
            phrases whenever that punctuation belongs to the whole sentence instead of the
            phrase in italic. For example, "that this should have happened to 
            <em>me!</em>" is silently
            changed to "that this should have happened to 
            <em>me</em>!" (89.3–4). 
         </p>
         
         <p>We do not admit the variant substantive readings of the Autograph Edition. We
            know that Cather did an unspecified amount of work on the text of the novel for
            the edition, and she may well have indicated specific changes she wanted or have
            agreed with Houghton Mifflin on blanket procedures for some
            accidentals and even some substantives (e.g., the change from two-word
            contractions like "did n't" to one-word contractions ("didn't"). In a letter to
            Norman Holmes Pearson dated 23 October 1937, for example, Cather notes that she
            made changes involving wording and punctuation even in the case of 
            <em>Death
               Comes for the Archbishop
            </em>, where the changes were not extensive, but that
            she read proof and revised proof of the Autograph text only when there were
            extensive changes. The substantive changes in the Autograph Edition text might
            have been authorial, but we believe that, taken together with the other features
            of this text and considering that it comes a quarter century after the first
            book edition of the novel, the differences reflect a different
            intention for the collected edition text, especially in evincing a more formal
            style. We are committed to providing readers with the most fully realized text
            belonging to the period of Cather's most complete imaginative engagement with
            her work, not with what might be in our opinion the "best" text of that work.
            When Cather made the revisions for the Autograph Edition, she and her publisher
            wanted a new and collected edition that would confirm her status as a major author,
            and Cather might
            have made a few changes with that new intention in mind. We have no external
            evidence of the particular changes she made, but we do not believe those changes
            should take precedence over the readings of the first book edition. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Some readers may be uncomfortable with this approach; they will argue that the
            relatively few substantive changes perfect the intention realized in 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i
            rather than contribute to what we have considered a new intention in the
            Autograph Edition. Such readers may prefer the readings of the Autograph Edition
            found in the Table of Rejected Substantives, which lists all substantive and
            quasi-substantive variants, other than those accepted as emendations, between
            our text, the 
            <em>McClure's</em> magazine text, and the text of the Autograph
            Edition. Because we do not consider variants from the Heinemann edition to be
            authorial, they are not included. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Records of Cather's direct involvement in the design and production of her works
            have led the Cather Edition to take special care in the presentation of them. We
            are particularly concerned with compositor error. By agreement with the
            University of Nebraska Press, we undertake proofreading in stages to meet the
            Committee on Scholarly Editions guidelines, which call for at least four
            readings. 
            <a href="tcn21" id="tcn21.ref" class="footnote"></a>  Insofar as is feasible within the
            series format of a scholarly edition, the editors have cooperated with the
            designer to create a volume that reflects Cather's known wishes for
            the presentation of her works.

         <h4>Table of Rejected Substantives</h4>
         
         <p>This list records substantive and quasi-substantive variants between the
            copy-text (
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i) and the texts of the novel in 
            <em>McClure's Magazine</em> and
            the Autograph Edition. The page, line number, and reading of the present edition
            text appear to the left of the bracket; to the right of the bracket appear, in
            chronological sequence, the variant readings and the abbreviations for their
            sources. Each variant is separated by a semicolon. Ellipsis dots indicate an
            omission made for the sake of brevity; they are not part of the Cather Edition
            text unless so indicated. If no reference is given, that text agrees with 
            <span class="smallcaps">HM</span>1.i.
            We have used the paragraph symbol without brackets to indicate variants in
            paragraphing; although typographical rather than substantive, such breaks
            sometimes have an effect on meaning.
