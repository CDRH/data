      <h4>Nursing as a Profession for Women.</h4>

      <p>THE fact that has nursing become so popular an occupation for women does not mean
         at all that men are excluded from it, or have abandoned it. Every class that graduates
         from the hospitals has its per cent. of male nurses, though usually the women greatly
         predominate.
      </p>
      
      <p>One continually hears nursing spoken of as one of the new professions for women. Why,
         I have always been under the impression that it is one of the oldest of all. Away
         back in the Iliad and Odyssey we hear Agamede commended for her skill in nursing,
         and even the beautiful Helen of Argos, often wrongly called Helen of Troy, is said
         to have "mingled with the wine a drug to lull all pain and sorrow and anger, and to
         bring forgetfulness of every sorrow…. Medicines of such virtue and so helpful had
         she, the daughter of Zeus." So I suppose by a liberal rendering of the passage one
         might almost call Helen herself a nurse, though her patients seem to have been a turbulent
         lot and small good it was that she ever did them.
      </p>
      
      <p>As early as 1311 we read of nurses and "women surgeons" in the old French chronicles,
         and they were common enough in England in King John's time. Of course it was Florence
         Nightingale, by her heroic services in the Crimea, who first brought nursing to the
         dignity of a profession. After her return to England the English people gave her a
         donation of £50,000 which she used in founding the Nightingale Home, the first regularly
         equipped training school for women nurses in England. The English women have always
         taken great interest in the nursing schools, and Queen Victoria's daughter Helena,
         Princess Christiana, has devoted much of her time to them. The first American nursing
         school was the Belleview Training School, established in 1873. Since then they have
         sprung up all over the country, and no large city is without several of them.
      </p>

      <p>Of course a training school cannot make a nurse, any more than a university can make
         a scholar. But the hopeful feature of a training school, or a school of any kind,
         for that matter, is that a few of the right people are sure to find their way into
         it. An aptitude for nursing is inborn. You cannot manufacture it by any process whatsoever.
         The profession is as old as the history of pain and compassion. There have always
         been nurses where there was suffering—and women. You remember in the little country
         town in which you grew up there was one woman who was always sent for in cases of
         emergency, who knew instinctively what to do and how to do it.
      </p>
      
      <p>My own grandmother was one of those unprofessional nurses who served without recompense,
         from the mere love of it. She had a host of little children and cares enough of her
         own, poor woman, but when a child was burned, when some over-worked woman was in her
         death agony, when a man had been crushed under the falling timber, or when a boy had
         cut his leg by a slip of the knife in the sumach field, the man who went to town for
         the doctor always stopped for her on the way. Night or day, winter or summer, she
         went. And they did not send carriages or cabs for their nurses in those days. She
         would go alone on foot across the snow-drifted fields and through the frosty pine
         woods in the dead of night, with a stout hickory stick in her hand and a basket on
         her arm. I have often heard the old folks tell how, during those dreadful diphtheria
         scourges that used to sweep over the country in the fifties, she would go into a house
         where eight or ten children were all down with the disease, nurse and cook for the
         living and "lay out" the dead. Sometimes there would be half-a-dozen deaths within
         a few days right in one family. But you have had grandmothers of your own, you know
         how it went. You remember the old woman who nursed you when you had scarlet fever,
         and walked the floor with you when you had whooping congh. Money will never buy such
         attendance for you again. The trouble with these old-fashioned nurses was that they
         so often did the wrong thing in perfectly good faith, and often the old-fashioned
         doctors could not tell them much better. In medicine, unfortunately, you cannot take
         the will for the deed. She was always an excellent woman, that nurse of the olden
         time, with her hair combed down over her ears and her big breastpin with a family
         portrait on it, but she used to make sad blunders. She and the old doctor would go
         on starving diphtheria patients and keeping ice and water from fever cases, sometimes
         killing more people than the disease, and all the while supported by an unwavering
         conviction that they were benefiting their kind. But given that natural instinct for
         the work, and supplement it with the knowledge and training which the nurse of to-day
         receives, and I am surprised that patients die at all.

      <p>The best training schools now have a three years' course, though many competent nurses
         are graduated under the two year system. All training schools are conducted in connection
         with some hospital, indeed, the hospital is the school. Hospitals usually have many
         more applicants than they can admit at once, so the prospective nurse files her application
         and letters of recommendation and waits her turn. When there is a vacancy she is admitted
         on a month's probation. The probationer begins in the charity hospital and is occupied
         with making the beds, changing the linen, and such duties as involve little responsibility.
         If at the end of the month she has proven that she has some adaptability for the work,
         she is examined in the common school branches and regularly admitted into the first
         year course. I have never talked with a nurse who found that first year a very pleasant
         one. There are distressing sights and sounds to become accustomed to, and, above all,
         there are most dis-

         tressing odors. The drudgery is especially unpleasant in that profession, principally
         because of the inexplicable prejudice against cleanliness that exists in certain classes
         of the human family.
      </p>
      
      <p>The first thing the new nurse does with charity patients is to try to get them clean,
         and though this sounds simple enough it is not always easily done. A young nurse told
         me only a few days ago of her struggle with one old woman in the charity ward. First
         she used alcohol, but it made no impression; then ether, then turpentine; finally
         she resorted to a stiff scrubbing brush and sapolio.
      </p>
      
      <p>Moreover, the hours are very trying to the novice, and the discipline is as rigorous
         as that in a convent school. The nurses must rise at just six o'clock, breakfast at
         just half-past six, and report for duty in the ward exactly at seven. Then they are
         constantly on duty until seven in the evening. Of course with the night force the
         hours are just reversed; but a first year student is seldom given any night work.
         Usually they have one day out of the seven for themselves, in the busy season only

         half a day. There is no way in which a nurse can earn a little time for herself by
         working over hours, for it is quite as important that she shall get her rest as that
         she does her work. The superintendent has no use for a nurse whose heavy eyes tell
         that she has not had sleep enough.
      </p>
      
      <p>The nurse often imagines that she understands the profession pretty thoroughly before
         she enters the school. She is perhaps a girl who has always attended to her little
         brothers' cut fingers, and set the dog's broken leg, and was celebrated among the
         neighbors for being able to endure the sight of a wound unmoved. She has only come
         to the hospital for a few finishing touches. If she has cherished any such delusion
         she soon discreetly forgets it and holds her peace. If the novice has her own ideas
         she had best keep them to herself. Ideas are supposed to come from the head nurse,
         who has an exclusive patent on them.

   <div class="milestone section"> </div>
   
   <div class="section doublespace ">
      
      <p>During her second year the nurse is usually put in charge of one of the night wards.
         Although the duties there involve less drudgery than she has been accustomed to, the
         responsibilities are heavy and it is, in the long run, the most wearing work of all.
         This is especially true in the larger cities, where all the worst accident cases invariably
         come in at night. Dear me, the stories that a night nurse at Belleview hospital used
         to tell me! If that young lady should take to making realistic novels she could outdo
         M. Zola himself in grewsome descriptions. Men with delirium tremens,—and sometimes
         women with the same disease—men who had been torn to pieces by machinery or burned
         in some tenement fire; men with several ounces of cold lead in them, and women with
         their throats gashed from ear to ear; and, most pitiful of all, little waifs who had
         been run over by a carriage or struck by some brute who was not even merciful enough
         to kill. So they would keep coming in from the ambulances all night long, poor waifs
         and strays of every class, nature's misfits, literally the wounded and slain of the
         weaker side that is forever being defeated in the battle of life. Peace hath its victories,
         they say; yes, and its victims. Every time the ambulance stops at the door it means
         another victim; a woman who has given up the fight that went always against her, and
         has taken carbolic acid; an unknown man from the West who has been shot in a bar-room
         brawl; and so on through the whole dreadful catalogue. And almost every accident could
         be traced to some direct ethical cause.
      </p>
      
      <p>If ever any one had a right to be a pessimist, that nurse had. But, on the contrary,
         she had managed to preserve a deep and abiding faith in humanity. She used to say,
         though, that it was sometimes almost too much for her when those big, sodden-faced
         fellows, whose skulls had been fractured by a policeman's club, got to building water-wheels
         beside some little creek out in the mountains, or flying kites on a hillside or telling
         their mothers how they had bumped their heads. Those were the hours when she used
         to wonder what it was all for, anyway.

   <div class="milestone section"> </div>
   
   <div class="section doublespace ">
      
      <p>A hospital ward is no canny place to be at night. Even the nurses who are used to
         it feel its gloom. The delirious patients are always wildest at night, and those who
         suffer much groan continually, and those who cannot sleep stare at you with big, hollow
         eyes that have whole life-tragedies in them. The mental pain, the desand pair disappointment
         that looks out of those people's faces is sometimes more pitiful than their groans.
         You rebel against the waste and suffering of it all. The patients have a most disagreeable
         custom of dying about four o'clock in the morning. And so many of the accident cases
         don't want to die, and fight to the last. Then there are the bodies to be attended
         to. The nurse usually has to make a brave "spurt" to get through the last four hours
         of the night. And a good nurse never calls the doctor unless it is absolutely necessary,
         for hospital physicians are always driven to death.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   <div class="milestone section"> </div>
   
   <div class="section doublespace ">
      
      <p>In her senior year the nurse usually has charge of the food, superintends giving the
         medicines, and assists the surgeons at the operating table. Then her life becomes
         comparatively easy. Usually the nurses all live in a dormitory near the hospital.
         When they are off duty they go in for recreation very heartily. The girls get along
         well together—perhaps because they do not see too  much of each other. Often the occupants
         of the same room in the dormitory will scarcely see each other for days. The novices,
         at least, have very little time or life outside of their duties.
      </p>
      
      <p>The compensation a nurse receives while in the hospital is very small, as the training
         is supposed to reward her for her services. Her necessary expenses, such as board,
         lodging, washing, etc., are defrayed by the hospital, and during the first year she
         usually receives ten dollars a month in addition to this. During the second year this
         is increased to fifteen dollars. When she has completed her course at the school she
         usually prefers nursing in private families to remaining at the hospital, as the pay
         is better. When she is nursing she receives from twenty to twenty-five dollars a week
         beside her board and lodging. The only trouble is that she can never be sure of steady
         employment. Nine or ten months' steady nursing is considered a very good average for
         the year. If she could get work enough to occupy all her time she would not be able
         to stand the physical strain. Even if she takes good care of herself a nurse breaks
         down early. If she can stand the work for fifteen years she does very well indeed.
         After that she usually goes back to a hospital where the work is lighter. That is,
         if she has not married some susceptible physician in the mean time.

   <div class="milestone section"> </div>
   
   <div class="section doublespace ">
      
      <p>Nurses tell me that the children, even the very little ones, are the easiest patients
         of all to handle. They can he coaxed into almost anything and will stand an operation
         very bravely if their favorite nurse is with them. Myself, I do not see how the nurses
         can ever accustom themselves to seeing children in pain, or how they can get over
         that feeling of the unfairness of it. If you have ever gone through the children's
         ward and seen the white-faced little fellows lying so patiently in their cots, perhaps
         forgetting their own suffering in caring for the imaginary ailments of their doll
         baby, you will not wonder at the enthusiasm of the Flower Mission folk. Those hospital
         babies always seem so much older than other children of their age, and usually are
         much more tractable.

      <p>Nurses have decided preferences as to their patients, though they seldom express them.
         Most of them prefer the men's ward to the women's. The men are more easily pleased,
         more grateful for what is done for them and more considerate of the nurse. The women
         are often disposed to

         be quarrelsome and to continually find fault. Usually the better class of patients
         are more easily suited than the charity cases. People who have always lived in poverty
         and squalor expect to be treated like princes of blood while they are at the hospital.
         All the vagrant class of patients have one common aversion, a hatred of soap and water.
         During her first year one of the nurse's principal tasks is scrubbing up dilapidated
         pieces of humanity. As a rule

      <p>Occasionally a nurse has the good fortune to be employed from year to year by some
         chronic invalid who is able to pay her liberally. Some few of the nurses study medicine
         and eventually practise, but this is not a usual sequel. The schools all over the
         country are graduating more nurses than there are patients able to employ them, and
         this has already hurt the profession from a business standpoint. But in this, as in
         every other trade, there is always room for the best. The world has never yet been
         over-stocked with excellence in any business. Native adaptability, a vigorous constitution,
         honest work and a strong personality will make their way anywhere. And above everything
         else a nurse needs a strong physical personality, the sort of positive and active
         good health that influences weaker people and acts like a stimulant upon the patient.
