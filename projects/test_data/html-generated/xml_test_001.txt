   <h4>"I'm Going to Marry Peggy"</h4>

   </div>
   
   
   <p>I WANT to marry Robert. (There! It took courage to write that even in this little
      book I never expect any one to peer into.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes, I have an overwhelming desire to marry him, and he wants to marry me, as every
      one as well as myself knows. To be sure, other men have asked me to marry them since
      Tom died, and more than once I have been inclined to agree, which is why I hesitate
      until my head sets its seal of approval upon my heart's desire.

   <p>He rose angrily. Before I realized he was going, the hall door—
      <em>slammed</em>.

   <p>I CAME back this evening on the same train with Robert, and, as if the fates had arranged
      things, every seat in the car
      
      
      
      was taken except the one beside him. And so with sudden daring I said:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ever since that day on the train I have been fighting despair. And this day, the day
      on which he told me he was to be married, came a letter from him.

         <strong>FLOATING TEXT</strong> DEAR MARGARET: I am writing this in the office, with Peggy beside me. Tomorrow, as
         I told you, is the appointed time. But Peggy refuses—flatly refuses. She knows (from
         what source I can not gather) that I have been your suitor for many years, and she
         thinks you are still my lodestar. I have, talked and argued with her. She's adamant!
         But she says this: that if you will tell her with your own lips, here in this office,
         that you will never marry me, she will, notwithstanding the rumor that I am still
         devoted to you.
      </p>

   <p>God has been good to—Peggy. And I believe she will gradually oust that sophisticated,
      skeptical Margaret.

   <h4>New York's Most Famous Child Model</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>IN New York there is a girl model sixteen years old who has been posing for fourteen
         years. Her name is Irene Marcellus, and she has long been celebrated among artists
         as one of the most gifted child models in the profession.

      <h4>A Magazine Cover Girl</h4>
      
      
      <p>THE girl has posed all through her childhood and little girlhood for illustrators,
         photographers, and sculptors, for magazine covers, for calendars, for fashion magazines,
         even for classic designs for the decoration of public buildings. Posing has never
         tired or bored her, and her mother has seen to it that neither her health nor her
         schooling was neglected.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A year ago, during a rather difficult pose which kept her arms outstretched, Irene
         wanted something to occupy her mind, and asked for a bit of clay to play with while
         the sculptor worked. When she stopped for rest she showed him a

         tiny Venus, excellently proportioned, and executed with genuine originality. After
         that she was welcome to all the clay she wanted, and she would come early and stay
         late to work with it. Then she took some clay home and made herself tools out of a
         couple of wire hairpins and some old penholders. Her mother moved the dishes out of
         the three top shelves of the kitchen cupboard—and thus began Irene's atelier.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Now Irene wants to model all the time; but so far it hasn't made her impatient with
         posing. There is a new interest for her now in watching sculptors at their work.
