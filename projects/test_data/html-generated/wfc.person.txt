         McGinnes became an assistant to Frederic Augusta Bailey, a nephew of circus pioneer
         Hachaliah Bailey. McGinnes eventually changed his name to James Anthony Bailey. His
         business associations included James E. Cooper, manager of the Cooper and Bailey circus,
         and P. T. Barnum, becoming full partners to establish Barnum and Bailey Circus in
         1881, which became Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in 1919. Under the
         astute management skills of James A. Bailey, Barnum and Bailey managed Buffalo Bill's
         Wild West for William F. Cody from 1895 until Bailey's death in 1906.

         cattle and horses from Mike Russell under Russellâ€™s TE brand, which later inspired
         Cody's TE Ranch in Ishawooa, Wyoming. Russell was born in Ireland and met Cody in
         Kansas in the late 1860s. Russell was probably Cody's oldest and closest friend; he
         remained friends with the entire Cody family long after Cody's passing, frequently
         traveling to the town of Cody to visit them.

         around the town of Cody, Wyoming, had a history of legal disputes with the Shoshone
         Irrigation Company. In 1899 Darrah filed a protest against the issuance of land patents
         for portions of the Shoshone Irrigation Company's Carey Act segregation including
         the Cody town site, claiming that the Shoshone Irrigation Company had not yet adequately
         irrigated the area in question. While Darrah's protest was not upheld when adjudicated
         by government authorities in July 1900, it did delay the acquisition of clear title
         to these lands by settlers and investors who had filed claims for them. Since the
         Shoshone Irrigation Company's profitability depended on selling water rights to settlers
         who expected to gain clear title to the irrigated lands under the Carey Act, protests
         such as Darrah's were a threat to the business interests of William F. Cody and his
         partners.

         role in cultivating William F. Cody's public image for 34 years. He was associated
         with all the various iterations of Buffalo Bill's Wild West from 1883 until 1916,
         often holding the title of general manager. His actual duties combined those of advance
         agent, location scout, press agent, and public-relations manager. Known for his florid
         language, Burke composed much of the copy for the Wild West's programs and advertising
         materials. In 1893 he published a biography of Cody entitled 
         <em>Buffalo Bill from Prairie to Palace</em>, which was timed to coincide with the Wild West's appearance at the Columbian Exposition
         in Chicago.  Details of Burke's own life are scarce, but it is unlikely that he ever
         held an actual military rank. Burke was of Irish descent, was born in Delaware, and
         apparently had some experience as an actor. He first met Cody in 1873 while serving
         as manager for the Italian actress Giuseppina Morlacchi, a cast member in Cody's first
         theatrical troupe and wife of John B. "Texas Jack" Omohundro.

         Cavalry Regiment (known as the "Rough Riders") during the Spanish-American War of
         1898. According to the regimental muster rolls, Tait was born in Chicago and resided
         in Raton, New Mexico, at the time of his enlistment. His civilian occupation was listed
         as "fireman." It is unclear whether Tait actually saw combat with the Rough Riders.
         He was assigned to I Troop, one of the troops left behind at Tampa, Florida, when
         the rest of the regiment shipped out for the invasion of Cuba. Other details of his
         life are likewise obscure.  However, William F. Cody's letters to Tait in the last
         few years of Cody's life show that Cody considered Tait a trusted friend and that
         Tait knew much about Cody's business affairs. Tait is listed as a member of Buffalo
         Bill's Wild West in route books for the 1899 and 1902 seasons; it is likely that Tait
         may have performed for Buffalo Bill's Wild West in other seasons as well. He was employed
         by the Sells-Floto Circus in 1916.

         by 1885. Originally billed as the "Cow-Boy Kid," Baker often competed with Annie Oakley
         in trick shooting contests (consistently won by Oakley), among other roles. Baker
         remained with the various iterations of the Wild West as long as Cody had an ownership
         interest in the show. After Cody's death, Baker became one of the chief custodians
         of the Cody legacy in 1921 as founder of the Buffalo Bill Memorial Museum (now the
         Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave) in Golden, Colorado. Baker operated the museum until
         his death in 1931.

         mining, irrigation, and later the development of oil fields. Beck was a key partner
         with William F. Cody in founding the town of Cody in 1896. Beck managed the construction
         and day-to-day operations of the Cody Canal for the Shoshone Irrigation Company, of
         which William F. Cody was president. Although the Shoshone Irrigation Company was
         not a success, Beck's other investments were profitable, and he became an important
         local leader in both business and politics. Beck served as mayor of Cody in 1903 and
         was a Wyoming state senator from 1913 to 1917. He ran unsuccessfully for governor

      <div class="note">Gordon William Lillie was born in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1860. His family moved
         to Wellington, Kansas, in the 1870s. In Kansas, Lillie encountered Pawnee Indians
         en route to reservations in Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma). Beginning in
         1879, Lillie worked as an interpreter and later a teacher for the Pawnee agency. In
         1883 Lillie served as a Pawnee interpreter for the first season of Buffalo Bill's
         Wild West. Lillie later created his own show, Pawnee Bill's Historic Wild West. Lillie
         was also involved in leading groups of so-called "boomers" (settlers) into parts of
         present-day Oklahoma as they were opened to white settlement in 1889 and 1893. After
         1893 Lillie and his wife May made their off-season home in Pawnee, Oklahoma. Although
         never as prominent as Buffalo Bill's Wild West, Lillie's show was generally profitable,
         enabling the Lillies to invest in land, livestock, and oil development ventures in
         Oklahoma. A long-time admirer of William F. Cody, Lillie formed a partnership with
         Cody in 1908. Their joint venture was formally known as Buffalo Bill's Wild West Combined
         With Pawnee Bill's Great Far East, but colloquially as the "Two Bills." Lillie retired
         from show business after the "Two Bills" show was seized by the sheriff in Denver
         in 1913 but was able to live comfortably from the proceeds of his investments for
         the remainder of his life. Pawnee Bill was often billed as "Major" Lillie, but he
         is not known to have served in the active military. Because "major" was a common courtesy
         title for U.S. Indian agents in the nineteenth century, Lillie's work on the Pawnee
         reservation (though not as an actual agent) may have been the basis for his use of
         the title.

         Agricultural College (now Iowa State University). As a faculty member at Colorado
         State Agricultural College (now Colorado State University), Mead assisted the Colorado
         state engineer's office and quickly became recognized as an expert in irrigation engineering.
         Mead was appointed Wyoming territorial engineer in 1888, and was Wyoming's first state
         engineer, serving until 1899. As such, Mead was intimately involved in the drafting
         and administration of Wyoming's water laws. Mead's engineering reports on the Shoshone
         River provided crucial backing for William F. Cody and his partners in the Cody Canal
         project. After leaving the state engineer's office, Mead served as an irrigation advisor
         for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and later for the Australian state of Victoria.
         In 1924, Mead was appointed commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. In that

         to arrest Sitting Bull in December 1890 during the Ghost Dance crisis, but his orders
         to Cody were rescinded by authorities in Washington shortly before the Lakota leader
         was killed by tribal police. Miles was the most senior officer in the U.S. Army from

         of the famous boxer John L. Sullivan's estate upon Sullivan's death in 1918.

      <div class="note">George K. Spoor (1872-1953) was an important pioneer of early American cinema. In
         partnership with Gilbert M. "Broncho Billy" Anderson (1880-1971), Spoor founded the
         Essanay Film Manufacturing Company in 1907. Essanay (which stood for "S and A," the
         founders' initials) was truly a motion picture studio, whose productions included
         many Westerns starring Anderson as well as a number of films featuring Charlie Chaplin.
         After Essanay disbanded in 1918, Spoor was involved in developing a new widescreen
         motion picture process in the 1920s, which did not become a commercial success. In
         1948 Spoor received an honorary Academy Award for his contributions to the early motion
         picture industry.

      <div class="note">Harry Heye Tammen was born in Baltimore in 1856. At the age of 21, he was a bartender
         at the Palmer House, a leading Chicago hotel. He was head bartender at the Windsor
         Hotel in Denver by 1895, when he joined Frederick G. Bonfils as co-owner of the 
         <em>Denver Post</em>. Bonfils and Tammen built the newspaper into a commercial success by practicing a
         highly sensationalistic brand of "yellow" journalism. The partners collaborated in
         other business ventures including the 
         <em>Kansas City Post</em> (1909-1922) and the Sells-Floto Circus (1904-1921), although it appears that Tammen
         was the more active partner in the latter. In 1913 Tammen engineered the collapse
         of William F. Cody's show business partnership with Gordon W. "Pawnee Bill" Lillie
         by orchestrating the local sheriff's seizure of the show's physical assets due to
         debts owed to a printing company controlled by Tammen. Tammen then used Cody's personal
         debt as leverage to ensure Buffalo Bill's appearances with the Sells-Floto Circus
         for the 1914 and 1915 show seasons. Tammen and Bonfils were important financial backers
         of Cody's motion picture project in late 1913. By 1915 Tammen's relationship with
         Cody was badly frayed, as Cody was exasperated with his business practices. Although
         Cody stopped touring with the Sells-Floto Circus at the conclusion of the 1915 season,
         Tammen did his best to maximize his own profits from Cody's name for as long as he
         could. Tammen died in 1924.

         After serving in the Union army during the Civil War, Wiley entered business as a
         hydraulic engineer and contractor.  In 1876, Wiley moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where
         he managed companies that provided water service and electric lighting to city residents.
         In Wyoming, Wiley's Big Horn Basin Development Company undertook two significant irrigation
         ventures.  The Bench Canal, begun in the 1890s and completed by 1907, diverted water
         from the Greybull River to irrigate an area then known as Germania Bench (the name
         was later changed to Emblem Bench due to anti-German sentiment during World War I).
         The town of Germania (now Emblem) in Big Horn County was a result of this successful
         project. Much less successful were Wiley's attempts to irrigate the area called Oregon
         Basin with water from the Shoshone River and to found a town (called Wiley) about
         twelve miles southeast of Cody.  The Big Horn Basin Development Company was unable
         to complete the necessary canal and went into receivership in 1908.  Solon Wiley lost
         much of his personal fortune in the process, and left the Basin to return to Omaha.
         The town of Wiley soon disappeared.

         Her 1920 memoir states that she met William Cody on May 1, 1865, while he was a private
         in the Seventh Kansas Cavalry on detached duty in St. Louis. The couple married on
         March 6, 1866. The Codys had four children: daughters Arta (1866-1904), Orra (1872-1883),
         and Irma (1883-1918), and son Kit Carson Cody (1870-76). The Cody marriage was often
         strained; with financial disputes, the premature deaths of two children, William Cody's
         long absences from his family, and his marital infidelities all contributing to the
         troubles. William Cody twice filed divorce petitions. The first was withdrawn upon
         the death of Orra Cody in 1883, while the second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming,
         in 1905. Louisa won the court case, thus, William Cody's petition for divorce was
         denied. The Codys eventually reconciled after 1910, and Louisa often accompanied William
         Cody in his travels with the Wild West during the show's final years. After William
         Cody's death, Louisa published a memoir (co-authored with Courtney Ryley Cooper) entitled
         
         <em>Memories of Buffalo Bill</em>, an account that portrayed her marriage as consistently loving and happy. She died
         in 1921.

         between Cody and Moses indicates that the two formed a romantic attachment between
         1884 and 1886. Cody gave Moses a fine set of riding equipment and invited her to a
         rendezvous in St. Louis at the beginning of the Wild West's 1886 season.  The relationship
         apparently did not endure.  Moses returned to Morganfield, where she was reported

         skilled cowboy from Oklahoma, served as a Private in Troops D and K with Theodore
         Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War. He fought in the Battles of
         Las Guasimas and San Juan Heights. In 1899, the year following the Spanish American
         War, veterans of Roosevelt's Rough Riders formed an organization, aptly titled Roosevelt's
         Rough Rider Association.  McGinty was greatly involved with the Association throughout
         his life and even served as its President in 1951. He also maintained a friendship
         with Theodore Roosevelt for years after the war. Part of preserving and bolstering
         Rough Rider memory came as William F. Cody recruited 16 of Roosevelt's Rough Riders
         to join Buffalo Bill's Wild West for the 1899 season and beyond. Roosevelt's Rough
         Riders in the Wild West became part of the Congress of Rough Riders and re-enacted
         the Battle of San Juan Hill, a martial drama that celebrated the United States victory
         in Cuba over the Spanish and met tremendous applause at each presentation. McGinty
         participated as the Color Bearer in the San Juan Hill performance during the 1899
         and 1900 seasons.  Upon learning of the act, Theodore Roosevelt wrote to William F.
         Cody in March 1899, giving his approval for the re-enactment and his soldiers' involvement.
         He wrote, "I am delighted that McGinty and [Thomas] Isbell are in it. They are thoroughly
         good men." The San Juan Hill routine was the zenith of the program through the 1901
         season when it was replaced by the Battle of Tien-Tsin. McGinty became a world champion
         bronco rider, led a nationally known cowboy music band, and authored stories on the
         Spanish American War and western life. His lifetime achievements as a cowboy, Rough
         Rider, and Wild West performer led to his enshrinement in the National Cowboy Museumâ€™s
         Hall of Great Westerners in 2000.

      <div class="note">Nathan Salsbury (1846-1902) was a veteran of the Civil War who later became an actor
         and a successful theatrical producer and manager. He joined Cody in 1884 as co-owner
         of Buffalo Bill's Wild West. His show business skills contributed greatly to the venture's
         success until his death in 1902.

      <div class="note">John Shangreaux (c. 1854-1926) was an Army scout of mixed Lakota and French ancestry.
         After witnessing the tragedy at Wounded Knee, he joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West as
         an interpreter and chaperone for "hostile Indians," Lakotas who had been taken into
         custody by the Army but permitted to tour with Cody in Europe. Shangreaux married
         Lillie Orr, an Englishwoman, in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1892. The couple continued to
         tour with the Wild West until about 1897. While several published references spell
         the family name "Shangrau," as Cody did, John and Lillie's descendants used the spelling
         "Shangreaux." The couple's collection of Northern Plains Indian artifacts is at the
         Wyoming State Museum in Cheyenne.

      <div class="note">Born near the Grand River in South Dakota and originally given the name Slon-He (Slow),
         Sitting Bull (ThathaÆžka IyothaÆžka) achieved fame first as a Hunkpapa Lakota warrior
         fighting Crows and, later, Americans. A veteran of the Great Sioux War and Little
         Big Horn, Sitting Bull resisted American encroachment into the West and continued
         fighting against Americans until he surrendered in 1881. Sitting Bull joined the Wild
         West Exhibition in 1885 in Buffalo, New York, after William Cody spent nearly two
         years trying to recruit him. As perhaps the most well-known Indian in America as both
         a survivor of Little Big Horn and a symbol of Indian resistance to westward expansion,
         the chance to sign Sitting Bull would only serve to increase Cody's prestige and generate
         publicity for the Wild West. Sitting Bull toured with Buffalo Bill's Wild West for
         only four months. Having grown tired of the travel and bustling cities, he decided
         to return to his home on Pine Ridge. In 1890 Indian agent James McLaughlin sent Indian
         police to arrest Sitting Bull. Shooting erupted and Sitting Bull was killed in the
         skirmish. Sitting Bull's son and six other Hunkpapas died, as did six policemen.
