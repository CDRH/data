      <em>The focus acknowledges the topicality and continued relevance
         of violence to discussions of literature and culture. How does an
         author "write" violence? Is the representation of violence
         fundamental to our experiences of art, as a commentator such as
         Girard has suggested? Is there something "new" in the
         twentieth-century's experience of violence? And can we identify
         specifically American encounters with violence--in terms of
         representation, mythologies, and narratives? And what does it mean
         to write about violence as a female author?

      <em>Cather has always been implicated and engaged with these
         debates, ever since Hemingway castigated her portrayal of the Great
         War battlefields. We enourage participants to think widely and
         laterally about the topic, however, and to think about the myriad
         forms in which Cather explores (and sometimes fails to explore)
         violence and its effects. Violence can be deployed in metaphorical
         and suggestive ways, as well as taking us back to Cather's war
         novel. Participants might well want to address the violence of
         dispossession, the violence implicit in acts of discovery and
         collecting, or the emotional violence of neglect or
         misrecognition.
