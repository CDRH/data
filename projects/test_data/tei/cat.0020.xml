            <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> objective of the Willa Cather Scholarly Edition is to provide to
                    readers&#8212;present and future&#8212;various kinds of information
                    relevant to Willa Cather's writing, obtained and presented according to the
                    highest scholarly standards: a critical text faithful to her intention as she
                    prepared it for the first edition, a historical essay providing relevant
                    biographical and historical facts, explanatory notes identifying allusions and
                    references, a textual commentary tracing the work through its lifetime and
                    describing Cather's involvement with it, and a record of changes in the text's
                    various editions. This edition is distinctive in the comprehensiveness of its
                    apparatus, especially in its inclusion of extensive explanatory information that
                    illuminates the fiction of a writer who drew so extensively upon actual
                    experience, as well as the full textual information we have come to expect in a
                    modern critical edition. It thus connects activities that are too often
                    separate&#8212;literary scholarship and textual editing. </p>
            <p>Editing Cather's writing means recognizing that Cather was as fiercely protective
                    of her novels as she was of her private life. She suppressed much of her early
                    writing and dismissed serial publication of her later work, discarded manuscripts and proofs,
                    destroyed letters, and included in her will a stipulation against publication of
                    her private papers. Yet the record remains surprisingly full. Manuscripts,
                    typescripts, and proofs of some texts survive with corrections and revisions in
                    Cather's hand; serial publications provide final "draft" versions of texts;
                    correspondence with her editors and publishers helps clarify her intention for a
                    work, and publishers' records detail each book's public life; correspondence
                    with friends and acquaintances provides an intimate view of her writing;
                    published interviews with and speeches by Cather provide a running commentary on
                    her career; and through their memoirs, recollections, and letters, Cather's
                    contemporaries provide their own commentary on circumstances surrounding her
                    writing. </p>
            <p>In assembling pieces of the editorial puzzle, we have been guided by principles
                    and procedures articulated by the Committee on Scholarly Editions of the Modern
                    Language Association. Assembling and comparing texts demonstrated the basic
                    tenet of the textual editor&#8212;that only painstaking collations reveal
                    what is actually there. Scholars had assumed, for example, that with the
                    exception of a single correction in spelling, <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi> passed
                    unchanged from the 1913 first edition to the 1937 Autograph Edition. Collations
                    revealed nearly a hundred word changes, thus providing information not only
                    necessary to establish a critical text and to interpret how Cather composed but
                    also basic to interpreting how her ideas about art changed as she matured. </p>
            <p>Cather's revisions and corrections on typescripts and page proofs demonstrate
                    that she brought to her own writing her extensive experience as an editor. Word
                    changes demonstrate her practices in revising; other changes demonstrate that
                    she gave extraordinarily close scrutiny to such matters as capitalization,
                    punctuation, paragraphing, hyphenation, and spacing. Knowledgeable about
                    production, Cather had intentions for her books that extended to their design
                    and manufacture. For example, she specified typography, illustrations, page
                    format, paper stock, ink color, covers, wrappers, and advertising copy. </p>
            <p>To an exceptional degree, then, Cather gave to her work the close textual
                    attention that modern editing practices respect, while in other ways she
                    challenged her editors to expand the definition of "corruption" and
                    "authoritative" beyond the text, to include the book's whole format and material
                    existence. Believing that a book's physical form influenced its
                    relationship with a reader, she selected type, paper, and format that invited
                    the reader response she sought. The heavy texture and cream color of paper used
                    for <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi> and <hi rend="italic">My &#193;ntonia</hi>, for example, created a
                    sense of warmth and invited a childlike play of imagination, as did these books'
                    large, dark type and wide margins. By the same principle, she expressly rejected
                    the anthology format of assembling texts of numerous novels within the covers of
                    one volume, with tight margins, thin paper, and condensed print. </p>
            <p>Given Cather's explicitly stated intentions for her works, printing and
                    publishing decisions that disregard her wishes represent their own form of corruption, and an authoritative edition of Cather
                    must go beyond the sequence of words and punctuation to include other matters:
                    page format, paper stock, typeface, and other features of design. The volumes in
                    the Cather Edition respect those intentions insofar as possible within a series
                    format that includes a comprehensive scholarly apparatus. For example, the
                    Cather Edition has adopted the format of six by nine inches, which Cather
                    approved in Bruce Rogers's elegant work on the 1937 Houghton Mifflin
                    Autograph Edition, to accommodate the various elements of design. While lacking
                    something of the intimacy of the original page, this size permits the use of
                    large, generously leaded type and ample margins&#8212;points of style upon
                    which the author was so insistent. In the choice of paper we have deferred to
                    Cather's declared preference for a warm, cream antique stock. </p>
            <p>Today's technology makes it difficult to emulate the qualities of hot-metal
                    typesetting and letterpress printing. In comparison, modern phototypesetting
                    printed by offset lithography tends to look anemic and lacks the tactile quality
                    of type impressed into the page. The version of the typeface employed in the
                    original edition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, were it available for
                    phototypesetting, would hardly survive the transition. Instead, we have chosen
                    Linotype Janson Text, a modern rendering of the type used by Rogers. The subtle
                    adjustments of stroke weight in this reworking do much to retain the integrity
                    of earlier metal versions. Therefore, without trying to replicate the design of
                    single works, we seek to represent Cather's general preferences in a design that encompasses many
                    volumes. </p>
            <p>In each volume in the Cather Edition, the author's specific intentions for design
                    and printing are set forth in textual commentaries. These essays also describe
                    the history of the texts, identify those that are authoritative, explain the
                    selection of copy-texts or basic texts, justify emendations of the copy-text,
                    and describe patterns of variants. The textual apparatus in each
                    volume&#8212;lists of variants, emendations, explanations of emendations,
                    and end-line hyphenations&#8212; completes the textual story. </p>
            <p>Historical essays provide essential information about the genesis, form, and
                    transmission of each book, as well as supply its biographical, historical, and
                    intellectual contexts. Illustrations supplement these essays with photographs,
                    maps, and facsimiles of manuscript, typescript, or typeset pages. Finally,
                    because Cather in her writing drew so extensively upon personal experience and
                    historical detail, explanatory notes are an especially important part of the
                    Cather Edition. By providing a comprehensive identification of her references to
                    flora and fauna, to regional customs and manners, to the classics and
                    the Bible, to popular writing, music, and other arts&#8212;as well as
                    relevant cartography and census material&#8212;these notes provide a
                    starting place for scholarship and criticism on subjects long slighted or
                    ignored. </p>
            <p>Within this overall standard format, differences occur that are informative in
                    their own right. The straightforward textual history of <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">My &#193;ntonia</hi> contrasts with the more complicated textual challenges of <hi rend="italic">A Lost Lady</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Death Comes
                        for the Archbishop</hi>; the allusive personal history of the Nebraska
                    novels, so densely woven that <hi rend="italic">My &#193;ntonia</hi> seems drawn not
                    merely upon Anna Pavelka but upon all of Webster County, contrasts with the more
                    public allusions of novels set elsewhere. The Cather Edition reflects
                    the individuality of each work while providing a standard reference for critical
                    study. </p>

                     <p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">ATE</hi> one brilliant April afternoon <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r2" target="en2">Professor Lucius Wilson</ref> stood at the head of
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r3" target="en3">Chestnut Street</ref>, looking about him with the pleased air of a man of taste who
                    does not very often get to Boston. He had lived there as a student, but for
                    twenty years and more, since he had been Professor of Philosophy in a Western
                    university, he had seldom come East except to take a steamer for some foreign
                    port. Wilson was standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the
                    slanting street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses,
                    and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still shining. The
                    gleam of the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r4" target="en4">river</ref> at the foot of the hill made him blink a little, not so much
                    because it was too bright as because he found it so pleasant. The few passers-by
                    glanced at him unconcernedly, and even the children who hurried along with their
                    school-bags under their arms seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should be standing there, looking up through his glasses at
                    the gray housetops. </p>
                     <p>The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs and the
                    watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down the hill,
                    descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow. His nostril, long
                    unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood smoke in the air, blended
                    with the odor of moist spring earth and the saltiness that came up the river
                    with the tide. He crossed <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r5" target="en5">Charles Street</ref> between jangling street cars and
                    shelving lumber drays, and after a moment of uncertainty wound into <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r6" target="en6">Brimmer
                    Street</ref>. The street was quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had
                    already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his
                    objective point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite
                    direction. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have slackened
                    his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal, appreciative glance.
                    She was a person of distinction he saw at once, and, moreover, very handsome.
                    She was tall, carried her beautiful head proudly, and moved with ease and
                    certainty. One immediately took for granted the costly privileges and fine
                    spaces that must lie in the background from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and elegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,&#8212;for, in
                    his way, he had an eye for such things,&#8212; particularly her brown furs
                    and her hat. He got a blurred impression of her fine color, the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r7" target="en7">violets</ref> she
                    wore, her white gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a
                    flight of steps in front of him and disappeared. </p>
                     <p>Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as completely
                    and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long anticipated, and
                    definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For a few pleasurable seconds
                    he quite forgot where he was going, and only after the door had closed behind
                    her did he realize that the young woman had entered the house to which he had
                    directed his trunk from the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r8" target="en8">South Station</ref> that morning. He hesitated a moment
                    before mounting the steps. "Can that," he murmured in amazement,&#8212; "can
                    that possibly have been <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r9" target="en9">Mrs. Alexander</ref>?" </p>
                     <p>When the servant admitted him, Mrs. Alexander was still standing in the hallway.
                    She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her hand. </p>
                     <p>"Is it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get here before
                    I did. I was detained at a concert, and <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r10" target="en10">Bartley</ref> telephoned that he would be
                    late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather have your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with me, while we
                    wait for Bartley?" </p>
                     <p>Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid walk, and with
                    her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He followed her through the
                    drawing-room into the library, where the wide back windows looked out upon the
                    garden and the sunset and a fine stretch of silver-colored river. A harp-shaped
                    elm stood stripped against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year's
                    birds' nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star
                    quivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a rich and
                    amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed in front of the
                    wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed chair and began to pour it,
                    while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite her and took his cup with a great
                    sense of ease and harmony and comfort. </p>
                     <p>"You have had a long journey, have n't you?" Mrs. Alexander asked, after showing
                    gracious concern about his tea. "And I am so sorry Bartley is late. He's often
                    tired when he's late. He flatters himself that it is a little on his
                    account that you have come to this <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r11" target="en11">Congress of Psychologists</ref>." </p>
                     <p>"It is," Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; "and I hope he won't be tired to-night. But, on my own account, I'm glad
                    to have a few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid
                    that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to know you." </p>
                     <p>"That's very nice of you." She nodded at him above her cup and smiled, but there
                    was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been there when she
                    greeted him in the hall. </p>
                     <p>Wilson leaned forward. "Have I said something awkward? I live very far out of the
                    world, you know. But I did n't mean that you would exactly fade dim, even if
                    Bartley <hi rend="italic">were</hi> here." </p>
                     <p>Mrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. "Oh, I'm not so vain! How terribly discerning
                    you are." </p>
                     <p>She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank glance brought
                    about an understanding between them. </p>
                     <p>He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly liked her
                    eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were like a glimpse of
                    fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather. </p>
                     <p>"Since you noticed something," Mrs. Alexander went on, "it must have been a
                    flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of the
                    people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they were talking of some one I had
                    never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it would seem that he grew up among the
                    strangest people. They usually say that he has turned out very well, or remark
                    that he always was a fine fellow. I never know what reply to make." </p>
                     <p>Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot gently. "I
                    expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well, Mrs. Alexander. Though
                    I will say for myself that I was always confident he'd do something
                    extraordinary." </p>
                     <p>Mrs. Alexander's shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of impatience. "Oh,
                    I should think that might have been a safe prediction. Another cup, please?" </p>
                     <p>"Yes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as you might
                    imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose their courage; and
                    some never get a fair wind. Bartley"&#8212;he dropped his chin on the back
                    of his long hand and looked at her admiringly&#8212;"Bartley caught the wind
                    early, and it has sung in his sails ever since." </p>
                     <p>Mrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and Wilson
                    studied her half-averted face. He liked the suggestion of stormy possibilities
                    in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that, he reflected,
                    she would be too cold. "I should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy. I don't believe
                    he remembers," she said suddenly. "Won't you smoke, Mr. Wilson?" </p>
                     <p>Wilson lit a cigarette. "No, I don't suppose he does. He was never introspective.
                    He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known. We did n't know exactly what to do with him." </p>
                     <p>A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander screened
                    her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw wavering bright spots
                    on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened. </p>
                     <p>"Of course," she said, "I now and again hear stories about things that happened
                when he was in college." </p>
                     <p>"But that is n't what you want." Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at her with
                    the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. "What you want is a
                    picture of him, standing back there at the other end of twenty years. You want
                    to look down through my memory." </p>
                     <p>She dropped her hands in her lap. "Yes, yes; that's exactly what I want." </p>
                     <p>At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson laughed as
                    Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. "There he is. Away with perspective! No past, no
                    future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The only moment that ever was or will
                    be in the world!" The door from the hall opened, a voice called "Winifred?" hurriedly, and a big
                    man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread, bringing with him a
                    smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air. When Alexander reached the
                    library door, he switched on the lights and stood six feet and more in the
                    archway, glowing with strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks.
                    There were other bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always
                    Alexander's picture that the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r12" target="en12">Sunday Supplement men</ref> wanted, because he looked as
                    a tamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r13" target="en13">head seemed as
                    hard and powerful as a catapult</ref>, and his shoulders looked strong enough in
                    themselves to support a span of any one of his ten great bridges that cut the
                    air above as many rivers. </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room over the
                    library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of white lights along
                    the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r14" target="en14">Cambridge Embankment</ref>. The room was not at all what one might expect of an
                    engineer's study. Wilson felt at once the harmony of beautiful things that have
                    lived long together without obtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of
                    Alexander's doing, of course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing before he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place
                    there,&#8212;that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for
                    his vigor and vehemence. He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in the
                    cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled above his
                    broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth hand, a
                    flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and
                    exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned. </p>
                     <p>"You are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells me." </p>
                     <p>"Yes, for a few weeks only. There's a meeting of British engineers, and I'm doing
                    another bridge in Canada, you know." </p>
                     <p>"Oh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your wife, was n't it?" </p>
                     <p>"Yes, at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r15" target="en15">Allway</ref>. She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most remarkable old
                    lady. I was working with <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r16" target="en16">MacKeller</ref> then, an old Scotch engineer who had picked
                    me up in London and taken me back to Quebec with him. He had the contract for
                    the Allway Bridge, but before he began work on it he found out that he was going
                    to die, and he advised the committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I'd
                    never have got anything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r17" target="en17">Mrs.
                    Pemberton</ref>, Winifred's aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway she asked
                    me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady." </p>
                     <p>"Like her niece?" Wilson queried. </p>
                     <p>Bartley laughed. "She had been very handsome, but not in Winifred's way. When I
                    knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white, with a splendid head
                    and a face like fine old lace, somehow,&#8212;but perhaps I always think of
                    that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair. She had such a flavor
                    of life about her. She had known <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r18" target="en18">Gordon</ref> and <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r19" target="en19">Livingstone</ref> and 
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r20" target="en20">Beaconsfield</ref> when
                    she was young,&#8212;every one. She was the first woman of that sort I'd
                    ever known. You know how it is in the West,&#8212;old people are poked out
                    of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done. I used
                    to go up from the works to have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It was very stimulating, for she could n't tolerate stupidity." </p>
                     <p>"It must have been then that your luck began, Bartley," said Wilson,
                    flicking his cigar ash with his long finger. "It's curious, watching
                    boys," he went on reflectively. "I'm sure I did you justice in the
                    matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot where
                    some day strain would tell. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r21" target="en21">Even after you began to climb, I stood down in the
                        crowd and watched you with&#8212;well, not with confidence</ref>. The more dazzling the front you
                    presented, the higher your fa&#231;ade rose, the more I expected to see <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r22" target="en22">a
                        big crack zigzagging from top to bottom</ref>,"&#8212;he indicated its course in
                    the air with his forefinger,&#8212;"then a crash and clouds of dust. It was
                    curious. I had such a clear picture of it. And another curious thing, Bartley,"
                    Wilson spoke with deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, "is that I
                    don't feel it any longer. I am sure of you." </p>
                     <p>Alexander laughed. "Nonsense! It's not I you feel sure of; it's Winifred. People
                    often make that mistake." </p>
                     <p>"No, I'm serious, Alexander. You've changed. You have decided to leave some birds
                    in the bushes. You used to want them all." </p>
                     <p>Alexander's chair creaked. "I still want a good many," he said rather gloomily.
                    "After all, life does n't offer a man much. You work like the devil and think
                    you're getting on, and suddenly you discover that you've only been <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r23" target="en23">getting
                        yourself tied up</ref>. A million details drink you dry. Your life keeps going for
                    things you don't want, and all the while you are being built alive into a social
                    structure you don't care a rap about. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I'd
                    have been if I had n'tbeen this sort; <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r24" target="en24">I want to go and live out his
                        potentialities, too</ref>. I have n't forgotten that there are birds in the bushes." </p>
                     <p>Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust forward as
                    if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him, wondering. His old
                    pupil always stimulated him at first, and then vastly wearied him. The machinery
                    was always pounding away in this man, and Wilson preferred companions of a more
                    reflective habit of mind. He could not help feeling that there were
                    unreasoning and unreasonable activities going on in Alexander all the while;
                    that even after dinner, when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley
                    had merely closed the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The
                    machinery itself was still pounding on. </p>
                     <p>Bartley's abstraction and Wilson's reflections were cut short by a
                    rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander was
                    standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she shook her
                    head. </p>
                     <p>"No, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor Wilson were
                quite comfortable. I am going down to the music-room." </p>
                     <p>"Why not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are tired of
                talk."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander," Wilson began, but he got no further.</p>
                     <p>"Why, certainly, if you won't find me too noisy. I am working on <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r25" target="en25">the Schumann
                    'Carnival,'</ref> and, though I don't practice a great many hours, I am very
                    methodical," Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an upright piano that
                    stood at the back of the room, near the windows. </p>
                     <p>Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair behind her.
                    She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling. Wilson could not imagine
                    her permitting herself to do anything badly, but he was surprised at the
                    cleanness of her execution. He wondered how a woman with so many duties had
                    managed to keep herself up to a standard really professional. It must take a
                    great deal of time, certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time.
                    Wilson reflected that he had never before known a woman who had been
                    able, for any considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual
                    passion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration, shading
                    his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even younger than in
                    street clothes, and, for all her composure and self-sufficiency, she seemed to
                    him strangely alert and vibrating, as if in her, too, there were something never
                    altogether at rest. He felt that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people
                    and what she demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten years she must know him;
                    and however one took him, however much one admired him, one had to admit that he
                    simply would n't square. He was a natural force, certainly, but beyond that,
                    Wilson felt, he was not anything very really or for very long at a time. </p>
                     <p>Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley's profile was still wreathed in
                    cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His shoulders were sunk deep in
                    the cushions and one hand hung large and passive over the arm of his chair. He
                    had slipped on a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r26" target="en26">purple velvet smoking-coat</ref>. His wife, Wilson surmised, had
                    chosen it. She was clearly very proud of his good looks and his fine color. But,
                    with the glow of an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer's face
                    looked tired, even a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly
                    above the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped
                    forward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson thought that
                    beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling weariness of on-coming middle
                    age. </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden under the
                    declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs. Alexander at the tea-table
                    in the library. </p>
                     <p>"Well," he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself, "there was
                    a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley at his club, more
                    psychologists, and here I am. I've looked forward to this hour all day." </p>
                     <p>Mrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. "And do you
                    remember where we stopped yesterday?" </p>
                     <p>"Perfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I have color
                    enough in me. Bartley makes me feel a faded <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r27" target="en27">monochrome</ref>. You can't get at the
                    young Bartley except by means of color." Wilson paused and deliberated. Suddenly
                    he broke out: "He was n't a remarkable student, you know, though he was always
                    strong in higher mathematics. His work in my own department was quite ordinary.
                    It was as a powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the
                    most interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a
                    scientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing qualities so
                    much oftener than we find force." </p>
                     <p>"And, after all," said Mrs. Alexander, "that is the thing we all live upon. It is
                    the thing that takes us forward." </p>
                     <p>Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. "Exactly," he assented warmly. "It builds the bridges into the future, over which the
                    feet of every one of us will go." </p>
                     <p>"How interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into the
                    future&#8212;I often say that to myself. Bartley's bridges always seem to me
                    like that. Have you ever seen <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r28" target="en28">his first suspension bridge in Canada</ref>, the one he
                    was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it sometime. We were
                    married as soon as it was finished, and you will laugh when I tell you that it
                    always has a rather bridal look to me. It is over the wildest river, with mists
                    and clouds always battling about it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging
                    in the sky. It really was a bridge into the future. You have only to look at it
                    to feel that it meant the beginning of a great career. But I have a photograph
                    of it here." She drew a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r29" target="en29">portfolio</ref> from behind a bookcase. "And there, you see,
                    on the hill, is my aunt's house." </p>
                     <p>Wilson took up the photograph. "Bartley was telling me something about your aunt
                    last night. She must have been a delightful person." </p>
                     <p>Winifred laughed. "The bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the hill, and the
                    noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But after she met Bartley
                    she pretended to like it, and said it was a good thing to be reminded that there
                    were things going on in the world. She loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he came to
                    the house. Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank, Early-Victorian manner. She
                    liked men of action, and disliked young men who were careful of themselves and
                    who, as she put it, were always <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r30" target="en30">trimming their wick</ref> as if they were afraid of
                    their oil's giving out. MacKeller, Bartley's first chief, was an old friend of
                    my aunt, and he told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which
                    really pleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk after
                    Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt Eleanor had found
                    him much to her taste, but she had n't said anything. Presently she came out,
                    with a chuckle: 'MacKeller found him sowing wild oats in London, I believe. I
                    hope he did n't stop him too soon. Life coquets with dashing fellows. The coming
                    men are always like that. We must have him to dinner, my dear.' And we did. She
                    grew much fonder of Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna,
                    and she thought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics, and
                    she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used to declare
                    that the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r31" target="en31">Prince Consort</ref> had <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r32" target="en32">brought all that stuff over out of Germany</ref>. She
                    always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him. She considered that a
                    newfangled way of making a match of it."</p>
                     <p>When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his wife still
                    confronting the photograph. "Oh, let us get that out of the way," he said,
                    laughing. "Winifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down. I've decided to go over to
                    New York to-morrow night and take a fast boat. I shall save two days." </p>
                  </div2>

               <div1 type="chapter" n="2">
                  <head type="main" rend="center">CHAPTER II</head>
                  <p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to
                     the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r33" target="en33">hotel on the Embankment</ref> at which he always stopped, and in the lobby he was
                     accosted by an old acquaintance, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r34" target="en34">Maurice Mainhall</ref>, who fell upon him with
                    effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to dine with him. Bartley never
                    dined alone if he could help it, and Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew
                    what had been going on in town; especially, he knew everything that was not
                    printed in the newspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian
                    novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London
                    and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them. He had
                    written a number of books himself; among them a "History of Dancing," a "History
                    of Costume," a "Key to Shakespeare's Sonnets," a study of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r35" target="en35">"The Poetry of Ernest
                        Dowson,"</ref> etc. Although Mainhall's enthusiasm was often tiresome, and although he
                    was often unable to distinguish between facts and vivid figments of his
                    imagination, his imperturbable good nature overcame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by becoming, in a reluctant
                    manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the
                    conventional stage-Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high,
                    hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.
                    He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face
                    sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.
                    Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had preconceived ideas
                    about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers
                    or mechanics. He hated them when they presumed to be anything else. </p>
                  <p>While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes of his old
                    friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed that they should go to
                    see <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r36" target="en36">Hugh MacConnell</ref>'s new comedy, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r37" target="en37">"Bog Lights."</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>"It's really quite the best thing MacConnell's done," he explained as they got
                    into a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r38" target="en38">hansom</ref>. "It's tremendously well put on, too. Florence Merrill and Cyril
                    Henderson. But <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r39" target="en39">Hilda Burgoyne</ref>'s the hit of the piece. Hugh's written a
                    delightful part for her, and she's quite inexpressible. It's been on only two
                    weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell's
                    box for to-night or there'd be no chance of our getting places. There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
                    She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time. The ones who have any imagination
                    do." </p>
                  <p>"Hilda Burgoyne!" Alexander exclaimed mildly. "Why, I have n't heard of her
                    for&#8212;years." </p>
                  <p>Mainhall laughed. "Then you can't have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It's
                    only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come
                    up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in
                    London&#8212;but what can one expect? Do you know,
                    Alexander,"&#8212;Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the
                    hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,&#8212;"do you know,
                    I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be
                    a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one." </p>
                  <p>Just then they drove up to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r40" target="en40">the Duke of York's</ref>, so Alexander did not commit
                    himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre. When they entered the
                    stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the
                    interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they sat down, a burst of
                    applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage. Miss Burgoyne and her donkey
                    were thrusting their heads in at the half door. "After all," he
                    reflected, "there's small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless has n't thought of me for years." He felt the
                    enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the
                    current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy. The audience had come forewarned,
                    evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey-girl ran upon the stage
                    there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and
                    Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing. </p>
                  <p>"You see," he murmured in Alexander's ear, as the curtain fell on the first act,
                    "one almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness.
                    Of course, Hilda is Irish,&#8212;the Burgoynes have been stage people for
                    generations,&#8212;and she has the Irish voice. It's delightful to hear it
                    in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the
                    hips&#8212;who ever heard it out of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r41" target="en41">Galway</ref>? She saves her hand, too. She's
                    at her best in the second act. She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see;
                    makes the whole thing a fairy tale." </p>
                  <p>The second act opened before Philly Doyle's underground still, with Peggy and her
                    battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r42" target="en42">potheen</ref> across the bog, and to
                    bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was
                    happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather. Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall's
                    sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest. As
                    Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended
                    upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft
                    fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful
                    brown eyes. When she began to dance, by way of showing the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r43" target="en43">gossoons</ref> what she had
                    seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar. After
                    her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r44" target="en44">ditch wall</ref> back of
                    Philly's <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r45" target="en45">burrow</ref>, where she sat singing <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r46" target="en46">"The Rising of the Moon"</ref> and making a
                    wreath of primroses for her donkey. </p>
                  <p>When the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the corridor. They
                    met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he
                    babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
                    Presently he hailed a tall, bearded man, grim-browed and rather
                    battered-looking, who had his opera cloak on his arm and his hat in his hand,
                    and who seemed to be on the point of leaving the theatre. </p>
                  <p>"MacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It's going famously
                    to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You'll never do anything like this again, mark me. A man writes
                    to the top of his bent only once." </p>
                  <p>The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded eyes and
                    made a wry face. "And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked. </p>
                  <p>"That's what I was saying," Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a
                    tone even more conspicuously confidential. "And you'll never bring Hilda out
                    like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl could n't possibly be better, you know." </p>
                  <p>MacConnell grunted. "She'll do well enough if she keeps her pace and does n't go
                    off on us in the middle of the season, as she's more than like to do." </p>
                  <p>He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went. </p>
                  <p>"Poor old Hugh," Mainhall murmured. "He's hit terribly hard. He's been wanting to
                    marry Hilda these three years and more. She does n't take up with anybody, you
                    know. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r47" target="en47">Irene Burgoyne</ref>, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a
                    romance somewhere back in the beginning. One of your countrymen, Alexander, by
                    the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe. I dare say it's
                    quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid
                    excitement was tingling through him. Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added
                    in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite
                    capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that. Here comes Sir Harry
                    Towne. He's another who's awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir
                    Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer." </p>
                  <p>Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his wife in
                    Tokyo. </p>
                  <p>Mainhall cut in impatiently. </p>
                  <p>"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously tonight, is n't she?" </p>
                  <p>Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously. "Do you know, I thought the dance a bit
                    conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy,
                    poor child. Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she
                    seemed quite uncertain of herself. A little attack of nerves, possibly." </p>
                  <p>He bowed as the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r48" target="en48">warning bell</ref> rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord
                    Westmere, of course,&#8212; the stooped man with the long gray mustache,
                    talking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda." </p>
                  <p>When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r49" target="en49">"The Cloak of Old Gaul</ref>." In a moment Peggy
                    was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest. He
                    even leaned forward over the rail a little. For some reason he felt pleased and
                    flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience. In the half-light he
                    looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling
                    with amusement Sir Harry's judicial frown. He was beginning to feel a keen
                    interest in the slender, barefoot <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r50" target="en50">donkey-girl</ref> who slipped in and out of the
                    play, singing, like some one winding through a hilly field. He leaned forward
                    and beamed felicitations as warmly as Mainhall himself when, at the end of the
                    play, she came again and again before the curtain, panting a little and
                    flushed, her eyes dancing and her eager, nervous little mouth
                    tremulous with excitement. </p>
                  <p>When Alexander returned to his hotel&#8212;he shook Mainhall at the door of
                    the theatre&#8212;he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late
                    before he went to bed. He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed,
                    he had almost forgotten her. He had last written to her from Canada, after he
                    first met Winifred, telling her that everything was changed with him&#8212;
                    that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he could; if he could not, then
                    all the more was everything changed for him. Hilda had never replied to his letter. He felt guilty and
                    unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really
                    forgot Hilda altogether. When he wrote her that everything was changed for him,
                    he was telling the truth. After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself
                    like a different man. One night when he and Winifred were sitting together on
                    the bridge, he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad
                    that he was sorry for,&#8212;one thing in particular,&#8212;and he asked
                    her whether she thought she ought to know about them. She considered a moment
                    and then said: "No, I think not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can't
                    be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal
                    things,"&#8212;here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a
                    quick, impulsive gesture&#8212;"oh, about those I should be very jealous. I
                    should torture myself&#8212;I could n't help it." After that it was easy to
                    forget, actually to forget. He wondered to-night, as he poured his wine, how
                    many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years. He had been in London
                    more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her. "All the same," he
                    lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda. You've made things come your
                    way, and I never thought you'd do it. </p>
                  <p>"Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of
                    something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft. But I never
                    thought she'd do anything. She had n't much ambition then, and she was too fond
                    of trifles. She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she
                    used to. Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all. Sometimes a
                    little jolt like that does one good. She was a daft, generous little thing. I'm
                    glad she's held her own since. After all, we were awfully young. It was youth
                    and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly. I should n't
                    wonder if she could laugh about it with me now. I should n't
                    wonder&#8212;But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if
                    one met her again." </p>
                  <p>Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed. </p>

                     <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine
                    o'clock he dropped in at the Duke of York's. The house was sold out and he stood
                    through the second act. When he returned to his hotel he examined the new
                    directory, and found Miss Burgoyne's address still given as off <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r51" target="en51">Bedford Square</ref>,
                    though at a new number. He remembered that, in so far as she had been brought up
                    at all, she had been brought up in <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r52" target="en52">Bloomsbury</ref>. Her father and mother played in
                    the provinces most of the year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an
                    old aunt who was crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage
                    altogether. In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed to have a
                    lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung tenaciously to such
                    scraps and shreds of memories as were connected with it. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r53" target="en53">The mummy room of the
                    British Museum</ref> had been one of the chief delights of her childhood. That
                    forbidding pile was the goal of her truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken
                    there for a treat, as other children are taken to the theatre. It was long since Alexander had thought of any of these things, but now
                    they came back to him quite fresh, and had a significance they did not have when
                    they were first told him in his restless twenties. So she was still in the old
                    neighborhood, near Bedford Square. The new number probably meant increased
                    prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was snugly settled. He
                    looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she would not be home for a good
                    two hours yet, and he might as well walk over and have a look at the place. He
                    remembered the shortest way. </p>
                     <p>It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went through <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r54" target="en54">Covent
                    Garden</ref> to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r55" target="en55">Oxford Street</ref>, and as he turned into Museum Street he walked more
                    slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he approached the sullen gray mass at
                    the end. He had not been inside the Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to
                    meet there; sometimes to set out for gay adventures at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r56" target="en56">Twickenham or Richmond</ref>,
                    sometimes to linger about the place for a while and to ponder by <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r57" target="en57">Lord Elgin's
                    marbles</ref> upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room, upon the
                    awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought of the British
                    Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things in the
                    world were assembled to make one's hour of youth the more precious. One trembled lest before he got out it
                    might somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness and
                    see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet. How one hid his youth
                    under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one's back upon all
                    that vaulted cold, to take Hilda's arm and hurry out of the great door and down
                    the steps into the sunlight among the pigeons&#8212; to know that the warm
                    and vital thing within him was still there and had not been snatched away to
                    flush <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r58" target="en58">C&#230;sar's lean cheek or to feed the veins of some
                    bearded Assyrian king</ref>. They in their day had carried the flaming
                    liquor, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r59" target="en59">but to-day was his!</ref> So the song used to run in his head those summer
                    mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked by the place very quietly, as if he
                    were afraid of waking some one. </p>
                     <p>He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The house, a
                    comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the four front windows
                    on the second floor, where a low, even light was burning behind the
                    white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were window boxes, painted white and
                    full of flowers. Bartley was making a third round of the Square when
                    he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a hansom-cab horse, driven
                    rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was astonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve. He turned and
                    walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda's number and
                    stopped. The hansom must have been one that she employed regularly, for she did
                    not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out quickly and lightly. He heard her
                    cheerful "Good-night, cabby," as she ran up the steps and opened the door with a
                    latchkey. In a few moments the lights flared up brightly behind the
                    white curtains, and as he walked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone
                    too far to look up without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling
                    that he had had a good evening, and he slept well. </p>
                     <p>For the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the office of a
                    Scotch engineering firm on <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r60" target="en60">Henrietta Street</ref>, and was at work almost constantly.
                    He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at his hotel. One afternoon, after
                    he had tea, he started for a walk down the Embankment toward <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r61" target="en61">Westminster,
                    intending to end his stroll at Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne
                    would let him take her to the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached
                    the Abbey</ref>, he turned back and crossed <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r62" target="en62">Westminster Bridge</ref> and sat down to watch
                    the trails of smoke behind the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r63" target="en63">Houses of Parliament</ref> catch fire with the sunset.
                    The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little
                    flickering flames; <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r64" target="en64">Somerset House</ref> and the bleached gray
                    pinnacles about <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r65" target="en65">Whitehall</ref>were floated in a luminous haze. The yellow
                    light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires.
                    There was a smell of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r66" target="en66">acacias</ref> in the air everywhere, and the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r67" target="en67">laburnums</ref> were
                    dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It was a sweet, lonely kind of
                    summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she used to be, was doubtless more
                    satisfactory than seeing her as she must be now&#8212; and, after all,
                    Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own young years that he was
                    remembering? </p>
                     <p>He crossed back to Westminster, went up to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r68" target="en68">the Temple, and sat down to smoke in
                    the Middle Temple gardens</ref>, listening to the thin voice of the fountain and
                     smelling the spice of the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r69" target="en69">sycamores</ref> that came out heavily in the damp evening
                    air. He thought, as he sat there, about a great many things: about his own youth
                    and Hilda's; above all, he thought of how glorious it had been, and how quickly
                    it had passed; and, when it had passed, how little worth while anything was.
                    None of the things he had gained in the least compensated. In the last six years
                    his reputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had been
                    called to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r70" target="en70">Japan to deliver, at the Emperor's request, a course of lectures at the Imperial University</ref>, and had instituted reforms throughout the
                    islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but in drainage and
                    road-making. On his return he had undertaken the bridge at Moor-lock, in Canada,
                    the most important piece of bridge-building going on in the world,&#8212;<ref type="editorial" xml:id="r71" target="en71">a
                    test, indeed, of how far the latest practice in bridge structure could be
                    carried</ref>. It was a spectacular undertaking by reason of its very size, and
                    Bartley realized that, whatever else he might do, he would probably always be
                    known as the engineer who designed the great <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r72" target="en72">Moorlock Bridge, the longest
                    cantilever in existence</ref>. Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had
                    ever done. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was using
                    lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had vexations enough,
                    too, with his work at home. He had several bridges under way in the United
                    States, and they were always being held up by strikes and delays resulting from
                    a general industrial unrest. </p>
                     <p>Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work than he
                    had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had never got so little
                    out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the demands made on his time by
                    boards of civic enterprise and committees of public welfare. The obligations
                    imposed by his wife's fortune and position were sometimes distracting to a man who
                    followed his profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many
                    worthy endeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was
                    becoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that success
                    would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only power that was in
                    itself another kind of restraint. He had always meant to keep his personal
                    liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first chief, had done, and not, like
                    so many American engineers, to become a part of a professional movement, a
                    cautious board member, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r73" target="en73">a Nestor <hi rend="italic">de pontibus.</hi>
                        </ref> He happened to be engaged in
                    work of public utility, but he was not willing to become what is called a public
                    man. He found himself living exactly the kind of life he had determined to
                    escape. What, he asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and
                    substantial comforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly;
                    overwork had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which
                    confronted him,&#8212;of that he was afraid. He was not ready for it. It was
                    like being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a thing
                    possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to be free; and
                    there was still something unconquered in him, something besides the strong
                    workhorse that his profession had made of him. He felt rich to-night in the
                    possession of that unstultified survival; in the light of his experience, it was
                    more precious than honors or achievement. In all those busy, successful years
                    there had been nothing so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness. This
                    feeling was the only happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the
                    only ones in which he could feel his own continuous identity&#8212;feel the
                    boy he had been in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked
                    his way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris without a
                    dollar in his pocket. The man who sat in his offices in Boston was only a
                    powerful machine. Under the activities of that machine the person who, at such
                    moments as this, he felt to be himself, was fading and dying. He remembered how,
                    when he was a little boy and his father called him in the morning, he used to
                    leap from his bed into the full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was
                    Life itself. Whatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of
                    concentrated thought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society;
                    things that could be bought in the market. There was only one thing that had an
                    absolute value for each individual, and it was just that <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r74" target="en74">original impulse</ref>, that internal heat, that feeling of one's self in one's own breast. </p>
                     <p>When Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were blinking
                    along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars were shining in
                    the wide sky above the river. </p>
                     <p>The next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish performance.
                    It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find, and he got no farther
                    than the Temple gardens and the Embankment. It was a pleasant kind of
                    loneliness. To a man who was so little given to reflection, whose
                    dreams always took the form of definite ideas, reaching into the future, there
                    was a seductive excitement in renewing old experiences in imagination. He
                    started out upon these walks half guiltily, with a curious longing and
                    expectancy which were wholly gratified by solitude. Solitude, but not
                    solitariness; for he walked shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy
                    companion&#8212;not little Hilda Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly
                    dearer to him than she had ever been&#8212;his own young self, the youth who
                    had waited for him upon the steps of the British Museum that night, and who,
                    though he had tried to pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked
                    an arm in his. </p>
                     <p>It was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him this youth
                   was the most dangerous of companions. </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>One Sunday evening, at Lady Walford's, Alexander did at last meet Hilda Burgoyne.
                    Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there. He looked about for her
                    rather nervously, and finally found her at the farther end of the large
                    drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men, young and old. She was apparently
                    telling them a story. They were all laughing and bending toward her. When she
                    saw Alexander, she rose quickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a
                    little to let him approach. </p>
                     <p>"Mr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?" </p>
                     <p>Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. "Long enough to have seen you
                    more than once. How fine it all is!" </p>
                     <p>She laughed as if she were pleased. "I'm glad you think so. I like it. Won't you
                    join us here?" </p>
                     <p>"Miss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway last
                    summer," Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again. Lord Westmere
                    stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand and looked at Alexander blankly. Hilda was a good story-teller. She was
                    sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a moment
                    only. Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her slender, supple
                    figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish skin and brown hair.
                    Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her active, girlish body with its
                    slender hips and quick, eager shoulders. Alexander heard little of the story,
                    but he watched Hilda intently. She must certainly, he reflected, be
                    thirty, and he was honestly delighted to see that the years had treated her so
                    indulgently. If her face had changed at all, it was in a slight hardening of the
                    mouth&#8212;still eager enough to be very disconcerting at times, he
                    felt&#8212;and in an added air of self-possession and self-reliance. She
                    carried her head, too, a little more resolutely. </p>
                     <p>When the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to Alexander, and the
                    other men drifted away. </p>
                     <p>"I thought I saw you in MacConnell's box with Mainhall one evening, but I
                    supposed you had left town before this." </p>
                     <p>She looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an old
                    friend whom she was glad to meet again. </p>
                     <p>
                        <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r75" target="en75">"No, I've been mooning about here</ref>." </p>
                     <p>Hilda laughed gayly. "Mooning! I see you mooning! You must be the busiest man in
                    the world. Time and success have done well by you, you know. You're handsomer
                    than ever and you've gained a grand manner." </p>
                     <p>Alexander blushed and bowed. "Time and success have been good friends to both of
                    us. Are n't you tremendously pleased with yourself ?" </p>
                     <p>She laughed again and shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, so-so. But I want to hear
                    about you. Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about the wonderful
                    things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated you. What was it,
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r76" target="en76">Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun</ref>? That sounds like <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r77" target="en77">'The Mikado.'</ref> And
                    what about your new bridge&#8212;in Canada, is n't it, and it's to be the
                    longest one in the world and has some queer name I can't remember." </p>
                     <p>Bartley shook his head and smiled drolly. "Since when have you been interested in
                    bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in everything? And is that a part
                    of success?" </p>
                     <p>"Why, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!" Hilda exclaimed. </p>
                     <p>"Well, I think we won't talk about bridges here, at any rate." Bartley looked
                    down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug impatiently
                    under the hem of her gown. "But I wonder whether you'd think me impertinent if I asked you
                    to let me come to see you sometime and tell you about them?" </p>
                     <p>"Why should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons." </p>
                     <p>"I know. Mainhall offered to take me. But you must know that I've been in London
                    several times within the last few years, and you might very well think that just
                    now is a rather inopportune time&#8212;" </p>
                     <p>She cut him short. "Nonsense. One of the pleasantest things about success is
                    that it makes people want to look one up, if that's what you mean. I'm like
                    every one else&#8212;more agreeable to meet when things are going well with
                    me. Don't you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do something that people
                    like?" </p>
                     <p>"Does it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I did n't want
                    you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you." He spoke very
                    seriously and looked down at the floor. </p>
                     <p>Hilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then broke into a
                    low, amused laugh. "My dear Mr. Alexander, you have strange delicacies. If you
                    please, that is exactly why you wish to see me. We understand that, do we not?" </p>
                     <p>Bartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger
                    about awkwardly. </p>
                     <p>Hilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her shrewd eyes.
                    "Come, don't be angry, but don't try to pose for me, or to be anything but what
                    you are. If you care to come, it's yourself I'll be glad to see, and you
                    thinking well of yourself. Don't try to wear a cloak of humility; it does n't
                    become you. Stalk in as you are and don't make excuses. I'm not accustomed to
                    inquiring into the motives of my guests. That would hardly be safe, even for
                    Lady Walford, in a great house like this." </p>
                     <p>"Sunday afternoon, then," said Alexander, as she rose to join her hostess. "How
                    early may I come?" </p>
                     <p>"I'm at home after four, and I'll be glad to see you, Bartley." </p>
                     <p>She gave him her hand and flushed and laughed. He bent over it a little
                    stiffly. She went away on Lady Walford's arm, and as he stood
                    watching her yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather
                    sullen. He felt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly. </p>

                  <p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation
                    and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he met
                    charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and
                    competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea. Alexander
                    arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in during the course of the
                    afternoon. Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his
                    teacup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deepset, faded eyes. He
                    seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a
                    robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing
                    his freshly creased clothes apprehensively. It was not very long, indeed, before
                    his coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his hair and
                    beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale. His dry humor went under a
                    cloud of absentminded kindliness which, Mainhall explained, always overtook him
                    here. He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young
                    girl's party. </p>
                  <p>The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r78" target="en78">Lady Kildare, the Irish
                     philanthropist</ref>, brought her young nephew, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r79" target="en79">Robert Owen</ref>, who had come up from
                    Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to
                    Miss Burgoyne. Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair,
                    flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about
                    nervously over his high collar. Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her
                    husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r80" target="en80">deranged
                        upon the subject of the fourth dimension</ref>. On other matters he was perfectly
                    rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation. He looked very much like
                     <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r81" target="en81">Agassiz</ref>, and his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and
                     tight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r82" target="en82">Mrs. Browning</ref>. Hilda
                    seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so
                    pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they
                    did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their
                    'bus. They asked him to come to see them in <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r83" target="en83">Chelsea</ref>, and they spoke very
                    tenderly of Hilda. "She's a dear, unworldly little thing," said the philosopher absently; "more like the stage people of my young days&#8212;folk
                    of simple manners. There are n't many such left. American tours have spoiled
                    them, I'm afraid. They have all grown very smart. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r84" target="en84">Lamb</ref> would n't care a great
                    deal about many of them, I fancy." </p>
                  <p>Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon. He had a long
                    talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a
                    discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he was nervous and
                    unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate
                    departure. On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a
                    hansom, and drove to Bedford Square. He sent up his card, but it came back to
                    him with a message scribbled across the front.

                  </p>
                  <p>When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty
                    little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs. Hilda was
                    writing in her living-room, under the light of a tall desk lamp. Bartley
                    recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady
                    Walford's. </p>
                  <p>"I'm so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know," he said,
                    taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r85" target="en85">canary
                    slippers</ref> to her smoothly parted brown hair. "Yes, it's very, very pretty. Every
                    one at Lady Walford's was looking at it." </p>
                  <p>Hilda curtsied. "Is that why you think it pretty? I've no need for fine clothes
                    in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r86" target="en86">duddies</ref> for myself. It's owing to
                    that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner. I don't need
                    Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway
                    girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been
                    here, for I remember you don't like English cookery." </p>
                  <p>Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything. </p>
                  <p>"I have n't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this
                    is. Where did you get those etchings? They're quite unusual, are n't they?" </p>
                  <p>"Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very much
                    interested in the American artist who did them. They are all sketches made about
                    the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r87" target="en87">Villa d'Este</ref>, you see. He painted that <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r88" target="en88">group of cypresses</ref> for <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r89" target="en89">the Salon</ref>, and
                    it was bought for <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r90" target="en90">the Luxembourg</ref>." </p>
                  <p>Alexander walked over to the bookcases. "It's the air of the whole place here
                    that I like. You have n't got anything that does n't belong. Seems to me it
                    looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many flowers. I like
                    these little yellow irises." </p>
                  <p>"Rooms always look better by lamplight&#8212;in London, at least. Though
                    Marie is clean&#8212;really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the
                    flowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden
                    market yesterday morning." </p>
                  <p>"I'm glad," said Alexander simply. "I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so
                    pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about
                    you. You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade
                    elephant from her desk. "Those fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They
                    don't talk of any one else as they do of you." </p>
                  <p>Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the
                    bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It's not worth much, but I
                    love it. I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my
                    three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons. He's
                    that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than
                    other fellows ever get. And I've traveled a bit, too." </p>
                  <p>Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served. </p>
                  <p>"My dining-room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you
                    have ever seen." </p>
                  <p>It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf
                    full of china. Hilda saw Alexander look up at it. </p>
                  <p>"It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's. Heaven
                    knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what
                    baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it has n't been stowed away. We always
                    had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the
                    queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre&#8212; queer
                    theatres, for that matter." </p>
                  <p>It was a wonderful little dinner. There was watercress soup, and sole, and a
                    delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small
                    rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had
                    always been very fond. He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was
                    still no other he liked so well. </p>
                  <p>"I have some champagne for you, too. I don't drink it myself, but I like to see
                    it behave when it's poured. There is nothing else that looks so jolly." </p>
                  <p>"Thank you. But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine
                    against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about. "You
                    have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris much these late years?" </p>
                  <p>Hilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully. "Oh, yes, I go over to Paris
                    often. There are few changes in <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r91" target="en91">the old Quarter</ref>. Dear old Madame Anger is
                    dead&#8212;but perhaps you don't remember her?" </p>
                  <p>"Don't I, though! I'm so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I remember
                    how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed till ten o'clock.
                    He was the laziest fellow at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r92" target="en92">the Beaux Arts</ref>; and that's saying a good deal." </p>
                  <p>"Well, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect when he will
                    work. He's a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever. But
                    Angel&#8212;do you remember Angel?" </p>
                  <p>"Perfectly. Did she ever get back to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r93" target="en93">Brittany</ref> and her <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r94" target="en94">
                        <hi rend="italic">bains de mer?</hi>
                     </ref>" </p>
                  <p>"Ah, no. Poor Angel! She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers in Madame
                    Anger's little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and then with another
                    soldier. Too bad! She still lives about the Quarter, and, though there is always
                    a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r95" target="en95">
                        <hi rend="italic">soldat,</hi>
                     </ref> she has become a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r96" target="en96">
                        <hi rend="italic">blanchisseuse de fin.</hi>
                     </ref> She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was
                    there, and was so delighted to see me again. I gave her all my old clothes, even
                    my old hats, though she always wears her <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r97" target="en97">Breton headdress</ref>. Her hair is still
                    like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the
                    same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her
                        <hi rend="italic">bains de mer.</hi>" </p>
                  <p>Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a
                    low, happy laugh. "How jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you remember that
                    first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down to the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r98" target="en98">Place Saint-Michel</ref>
                    to buy some <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r99" target="en99">lilacs</ref>. Do you remember how sweet they smelled?" </p>
                  <p>"Indeed I do. Come, we'll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke." </p>
                  <p>Hilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk, but
                    Bartley found it pleasant to continue it. </p>
                  <p>"What a warm, soft spring evening that was," he went on, as they sat down in the
                    study with the coffee on a little table between them; "and the sky, over the
                    bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked on down by the river, did
                    n't we?" </p>
                  <p>Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly. He saw a gleam in her eyes that he
                    remembered even better than the episode he was recalling. </p>
                  <p>"I think we did," she answered demurely. "It was on <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r100" target="en100">the Quai</ref> we met that woman
                    who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you
                    gave her a franc. I was frightened at your prodigality." </p>
                  <p>"I expect it was the last franc I had. What a strong brown face she had, and very
                    tragic. She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black
                    shawl. What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs,
                    but just our youth. I remember it touched me so. I would have given her some of
                    mine off my back, if I could. I had enough and to spare then," Bartley mused,
                    and looked thoughtfully at his cigar. </p>
                  <p>They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God
                    give you a happy love!" It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual
                    beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating
                    with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had
                    the anguish of a voice of prophecy. Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized
                    that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang
                    out so sharply, had frightened them both. They went home sadly with the lilacs,
                    back to the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r101" target="en101">Rue Saint-Jacques</ref>, walking very slowly, arm in arm. When they
                    reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had
                    kissed her for the first time. He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he
                    remembered, and she had trembled so&#8212; </p>
                  <p>Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. "Dear me, why did you
                    do that? I had quite forgotten&#8212;I was back there. It was very jolly,"
                    he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee. </p>
                  <p>Hilda laughed and went over to the piano. "Well, we are neither of us twenty now,
                    you know. Have I told you about my new play? <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r102" target="en102">Mac is writing one; really for me
                        this time</ref>. You see, I'm coming on." </p>
                  <p>"I've seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear yellow gowns?
                    I hope so." </p>
                  <p>He was looking at her round, slender figure, as she stood by the piano, turning
                    over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of it. </p>
                  <p>"No, it is n't a dress-up part. He does n't seem to fancy me in fine feathers. He
                    says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose I ought. But he's
                    given me some good Irish songs. Listen." </p>
                  <p>She sat down at the piano and sang. When she finished, Alexander shook himself
                    out of a reverie. "Sing <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r103" target="en103">'The Harp that Once,'</ref> Hilda. You used to sing it so
                    well."</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense. Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and
                    grandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I
                    tried a master; but he confused me, just!" </p>
                  <p>Alexander laughed. "All the same, sing it, Hilda." </p>
                  <p>Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. "It's
                    really too warm in this room to sing. Don't you feel it?" </p>
                  <p>Alexander went over and opened the window for her. "Are n't you afraid to let the
                    wind blow like that on your neck? Can't I get a scarf or something?" </p>
                  <p>"Ask a theatre lydy if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed. "But perhaps, as
                    I'm so warm&#8212;give me your handkerchief. There, just in front." He
                    slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps. "There, that will do.
                    It looks like a bib." She pushed his hand away quickly and stood looking out
                    into the deserted square. "Is n't London a tomb on Sunday night?" </p>
                  <p>Alexander caught the agitation in her voice. He stood a little behind her, and
                    tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty. See how white the
                    stars are." </p>
                  <p>For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke. They stood close together,
                    looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more quickly and lightly,
                    and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world had stopped. Suddenly he moved the clenched hand he held behind him and dropped it
                    violently at his side. He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in
                    front of him. </p>
                  <p>She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning
                    round. "Here, take it. You must go now, Bartley. Good-night." </p>
                  <p>Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear:
                    "You are giving me a chance?" </p>
                  <p>"Yes. Take it and go. This is n't fair, you know. Good-night." </p>
                  <p>Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides. With one he threw down the
                    window and with the other&#8212;still standing behind her&#8212;he drew
                    her back against him. </p>
                  <p>She uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his face down to
                hers. "Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered. </p>

                     <p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> was the afternoon of the day before Christmas. Mrs. Alexander had
                    been driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of her
                    friends. She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she spoke to the
                    butler: "Thomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see Norah. In half an
                    hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar and put them in the library.
                    Mr. Alexander will be home at three to hang them himself. Don't forget the
                    stepladder, and plenty of tacks and string. You may bring the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r104" target="en104">azaleas</ref> upstairs.
                    Take the white one to Mr. Alexander's study. Put the two pink ones in this room,
                    and the red one in the drawing-room." </p>
                     <p>A little before three o'clock Mrs. Alexander went into the library to see that
                    everything was ready. She pulled the window shades high, for the weather was
                    dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in the streets. A foot of snow
                    had fallen during the morning, and the wide space over the river was thick with
                    flying flakes that fell and wreathed the masses of
                    floating ice. </p>
                     <p>Winifred was standing by the window when she heard the front door open. She
                    hurried to the hall as Alexander came stamping in, covered with snow. He kissed
                    her joyfully and brushed away the snow that fell on her hair. </p>
                     <p>"I wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me, Winifred.
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r105" target="en105">The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the pond</ref> and are
                    skating furiously. Did the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r106" target="en106">cyclamens</ref> come?" </p>
                     <p>"An hour ago. What splendid ones! But are n't you frightfully extravagant?" </p>
                     <p>"Not for Christmas-time. I'll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall be down in
                    a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready." </p>
                     <p>When Alexander reappeared, he took his wife's arm and went with her into the
                    library. "When did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the white one in my
                    room." </p>
                     <p>"I told him to put it there." </p>
                     <p>"But, I say, it's much the finest of the lot!" </p>
                     <p>"That's why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room for a red
                    one, you know." </p>
                     <p>Bartley began to sort the greens. "It looks very splendid there, but I feel
                    piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than anywhere else
                    in the house. Will you hand me the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r107" target="en107">holly</ref>?" </p>
                     <p>He climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began to twist
                    the tough stems of the holly into the framework of the chandelier. </p>
                     <p>"I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning, explaining
                    his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in Vermont has
                    conveniently died and left Wilson a little money&#8212;something like ten
                    thousand. He's coming on to settle up the estate. Won't it be jolly to have
                    him?" </p>
                     <p>"And how fine that he's come into a little money. I can see him posting down
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r108" target="en108">State Street</ref> to the steamship offices. He will get a good many trips out of that
                    ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected him here for luncheon." </p>
                     <p>"Those trains from Albany are always late. He'll be along sometime this
                    afternoon. And now, don't you want to go upstairs and lie down for an hour?
                    You've had a busy morning and I don't want you to be tired to-night." </p>
                     <p>After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the greens for a
                    few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of string, he sighed suddenly
                    and sat down, staring out of the window at the snow. The animation died out of
                    his face, but in his eyes there was a restless light, a look of apprehension and
                    suspense. He kept clasping and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to
                    realize something. The clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the
                    afternoon outside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he
                    first sat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands
                    between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself away from
                    his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in which he sat, from
                    everything except the wild eddies of snow above the river on which his eyes were
                    fixed with feverish intentness, as if he were trying to project himself thither.
                    When at last Lucius Wilson was announced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet
                    and hurried to meet his old instructor. </p>
                     <p>"Hello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot of people
                    to dinner to-night, and Winifred's lying down. You will excuse her, won't you?
                    And now what about yourself ? Sit down and tell me everything." </p>
                     <p>"I think I'd rather move about, if you don't mind. I've been sitting in the train
                    for a week, it seems to me." Wilson stood before the fire with his hands behind
                    him and looked about the room. "You <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been busy. Bartley, if I'd had
                    my choice of all possible places in which to spend Christmas, your house would
                    certainly be the place I'd have chosen. Happy people do a great deal for their friends. A house
                    like this throws its warmth out. I felt it distinctly as I was coming through
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r109" target="en109">the Berkshires</ref>. I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs. Bartley again so
                    soon." </p>
                     <p>"Thank you, Wilson. She'll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea now? I'll
                    ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I always wreck the
                    house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am quite tired. Looks as if I
                    were not used to work, does n't it?" Alexander laughed and dropped into a chair.
                    "You know, I'm sailing the day after New Year's." </p>
                     <p>"Again? Why, you've been over twice since I was here in the spring, have n't
                    you?" </p>
                     <p>"Oh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the hot weather
                    more than anything else. I shan't be gone more than a month this time. Winifred
                    and I have been up in Canada for most of the autumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on
                    my back all the time. I never had so much trouble with a job before." Alexander
                    moved about restlessly and fell to poking the fire. </p>
                     <p>"Have n't I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r110" target="en110">a tidewater
                    bridge of yours in New Jersey</ref>?" </p>
                     <p>"Oh, that does n't amount to anything. It's held up by a steel strike. A bother,
                    of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up with. But the
                    Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety. You see, the truth is, we are having to
                    build pretty well to the strain limit up there. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r111" target="en111">They've crowded me too much on
                    the cost</ref>. It's all very well if everything goes well, but these estimates have
                    never been used for anything of such length before. However, there's nothing to
                    be done. They hold me to the scale I've used in shorter bridges. The last thing
                    a bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build." </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>When Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study, where he
                    found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table. </p>
                     <p>"These pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings," she said, smiling, "and I am
                    sure she meant them for you." </p>
                     <p>Bartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the wreaths in
                    the windows. "Have you a moment, Winifred? I have just now been thinking that
                    this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?" He went up to the table and
                    took her hands away from the flowers, drying them with his pocket
                    handkerchief. </p>
                     <p>"They've been awfully happy ones, all of them, have n't they?" He took her in his
                    arms and bent back, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss. "You are
                    happy, are n't you, Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you
                    to be happy. Sometimes, of late, I've thought you looked as if you were
                    troubled." </p>
                     <p>"No; it's only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried, Bartley. I
                    wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don't, always." She looked
                    earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes. </p>
                     <p>Alexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and forth in
                    his own, laughing his big blond laugh. </p>
                     <p>"I'm growing older, my dear; that's what you feel. Now, may I show you something?
                    I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear them to-night." He
                    took a little leather box out of his pocket and opened it. On the white velvet
                    lay two long pendants of curiously worked gold, set with pearls. Winifred looked
                    from the box to Bartley and exclaimed:&#8212; </p>
                     <p>"Where did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?" </p>
                     <p>"It's old Flemish. Is n't it fine?" </p>
                     <p>"They are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear earrings." </p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted you to. So few women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with,
                    and a nose"&#8212;he waved his hand&#8212;"above reproach. Most women
                    look silly in them. They go only with faces like yours&#8212;very, very
                    proud, and just a little hard." </p>
                     <p>Winifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate springs
                    to the lobes of her ears. "Oh, Bartley, that old foolishness about my being
                    hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down now. People are beginning
                    to come." </p>
                     <p>Bartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her. "Not hard to
                    me, Winifred," he whispered. "Never, never hard to me." </p>
                     <p>Left alone, he paced up and down his study. He was at home again, among all the
                    dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years. His house tonight
                    would be full of charming people, who liked and admired him. Yet all the time,
                    underneath his pleasure and hopefulness and satisfaction, he was conscious of
                    the vibration of an unnatural excitement. Amid this light and warmth and
                    friendliness, he sometimes started and shuddered, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r112" target="en112">as if some one had stepped on
                    his grave</ref>. Something had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except
                    that it was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him. Sometimes
                    it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries. Sometimes it battered him like the cannon
                    rolling in the hold of the vessel. Always, now, it brought with it a sense of
                    quickened life, of stimulating danger. To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he
                    was walking the floor, after his wife left him. It seemed impossible;
                    he could not believe it. He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her
                    back. He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down. Going
                    over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river. How could this
                    happen here, in his own house, among the things he loved? What was it that
                    reached in out of the darkness and thrilled him? As he stood there he had a
                    feeling that he would never escape. He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead
                    against the cold window glass, breathing in the chill that came through it.
                    "That this," he groaned, "that this should have happened to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>" </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>On New Year's day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain fell. In
                    the morning, the morning of Alexander's departure for England, the river was
                    streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the windows of the
                    breakfast-room. Alexander had finished his coffee and was pacing up and down.
                    His wife sat at the table, watching him. She was pale and unnaturally calm. When Thomas brought the letters, Bartley sank into his chair and ran them
                    over rapidly. </p>
                     <p>"Here's a note from old Wilson. He's safe back at his grind, and says he had a
                    bully time. 'The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole winter fragrant.'
                    Just like him. He will go on getting measureless satisfaction out of you by his
                    study fire. What a man he is for looking on at life!" Bartley sighed, pushed the
                    letters back impatiently, and went over to the window. "This is a nasty sort of
                    day to sail. I've a notion to call it off. Next week would be time enough." </p>
                     <p>"That would only mean starting twice. It would n't really help you out at all,"
                    Mrs. Alexander spoke soothingly. "And you'd come back late for all your
                    engagements." </p>
                     <p>Bartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket. "I wish things would let
                    me rest. I'm tired of work, tired of people, tired of trailing about." He looked
                    out at the storm-beaten river. </p>
                     <p>Winifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. "That's what you
                    always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these things. Can't you
                    remember that?" </p>
                     <p>He put his arm about her. "All the same, life runs smoothly enough with some
                    people, and with me it's always a messy sort of patchwork. It's <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r113" target="en113">like the song; peace is where I am not</ref>.
                    How can you face it all with so much fortitude?" </p>
                     <p>She looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much admired, which he
                    had felt implied such high confidence and fearless pride. "Oh, I faced that long
                    ago, when you were on your first bridge, up at old Allway. I knew then that your
                    paths were not to be <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r114" target="en114">paths of peace</ref>, but I decided that I wanted to follow
                    them." </p>
                     <p>Bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in the
                    grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r115" target="en115">Angora</ref> looked
                    up at them curiously. </p>
                     <p>Presently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door. "Shall Edward bring down your
                    trunks, sir?" </p>
                     <p>"Yes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study
                    table." </p>
                     <p>Thomas withdrew, closing the door softly. Bartley turned away from his wife,
                    still holding her hand. "It never gets any easier, Winifred." </p>
                     <p>They both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside. Alexander
                    sat down and leaned his head on his hand. His wife bent over him. "Courage," she
                    said gayly. Bartley rose and rang the bell. Thomas brought him his hat and stick
                    and ulster. At the sight of these, the supercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted her red cushion by the
                    fire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous indications of
                    change. Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then plunged into his coat and drew
                    on his gloves. His wife held his stick, smiling. Bartley smiled too, and his
                    eyes cleared. "I'll work like the devil, Winifred, and be home again before you
                    realize I've gone." He kissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the
                    front door into the rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the
                    driver was starting his melancholy, dripping black horses. Alexander sat with
                    his hands clenched on his knees. As the carriage turned up the hill, he lifted
                    one hand and brought it down violently. "This time"&#8212;he spoke aloud and
                    through his set teeth&#8212;"this time I'm going to end it!" </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>On the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r116" target="en116">to the stern,
                    on the windward side</ref> where the chairs were few, his rugs over him and the collar
                    of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears. The weather had so far been dark
                    and raw. For two hours he had been watching the low, dirty sky and the beating
                    of the heavy rain upon the iron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that
                    made exercise laborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid that drops of moisture kept gathering upon
                    his hair and mustache. He seldom moved except to brush them away. The great open
                    spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him. He
                    intended during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all
                    this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion. Deep down
                    in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and strengthening, ebbing and
                    flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on as steadily as his
                    pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was submerged in the vast
                    impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals the sidelong roll of the boat
                    measured off time like the ticking of a clock. He felt released from everything
                    that troubled and perplexed him. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted
                    torturing memories, had actually managed to get on board without them. He
                    thought of nothing at all. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the
                    grayness, it was Lucius Wilson's, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten
                    for years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to hunt
                    jackrabbits with when he was a boy. </p>
                     <p>Toward six o'clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and brought the
                    swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet deck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing himself in the obliterating
                    blackness and drowsing in the rush of the gale. Before he went below a few
                    bright stars were pricked off between heavily moving masses of cloud. </p>
                     <p>The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander felt the
                    need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he went on deck the
                    sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white cloud, smoke-colored at
                    the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water was roughish, a cold, clear
                    indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley walked for two hours, and then stretched
                    himself in the sun until lunch-time. </p>
                     <p>In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he walked the deck
                    through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose continually. It was agreeable
                    to come to himself again after several days of numbness and torpor. He stayed
                    out until the last tinge of violet had faded from the water. There was literally
                    a taste of life on his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of
                    champagne. He was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than
                    he had meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was almost
                    deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy fur coat about
                    his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen exhilaration. The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the shelter of the stern, the
                    wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of warm air, a sense of close and
                    intimate companionship. He started back and tore his coat open as if something
                    warm were actually clinging to him beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went
                    into the saloon parlor, full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp
                    wind. He threw himself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and
                    played accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had
                    followed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He played bridge
                    until two o'clock in the morning, and managed to lose a considerable sum of
                    money without really noticing that he was doing so. </p>
                     <p>After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently dull. When
                    the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun did no more
                    than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark brightness of newly
                    cut lead. Through one after another of those gray days Alexander drowsed and
                    mused, drinking in the grateful moisture. But the complete peace of the first
                    part of the voyage was over. Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if
                    driven out, and paced the deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for
                    walking in rough weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied
                    he must be thinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever
                    bridge in Canada. </p>
                     <p>But Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night out, when
                    his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been continually hammering
                    away at himself. More and more often, when he first wakened in the morning or
                    when he stepped into a warm place after being chilled on the deck, he felt a
                    sudden painful delight at being nearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most
                    despondent, when he thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a
                    flash he was free of it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness
                    of himself. On the instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness,
                    the intense excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth. </p>

                  <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The
                     stop at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r117" target="en117">Queenstown</ref>, the tedious passage up <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r118" target="en118">the Mersey</ref>, were things that he noted
                     dimly through his growing impatience. He had planned to stop in <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r119" target="en119">Liverpool</ref>; but,
                     instead, he took the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r120" target="en120">boat train</ref> for London. </p>
                  <p>Emerging at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r121" target="en121">Euston</ref> at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his
                    luggage sent to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r122" target="en122">the Savoy</ref> and drove at once to Bedford Square. When Marie met
                    him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her
                    surprise and delight. She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her
                    confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway,
                    buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to
                    Hilda's living-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was
                    crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to
                    grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood his ground over by the
                    windows until Hilda came in. She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him
                    and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She
                    merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on
                    either shoulder. </p>
                  <p>"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke
                    this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be
                    Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never dreamed it would be
                    you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like this? Come over to the fire;
                    you're chilled through." </p>
                  <p>She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the
                    opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a
                    happy little girl. </p>
                  <p>"When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You have n't spoken a word."</p>
                  <p>"I got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and came
                    down on the boat train." Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before
                    the blaze. Hilda watched him with perplexity. "There's something troubling you,
                    Bartley. What is it?" Bartley bent lower over the fire. "It's the whole thing
                    that troubles me, Hilda. You and I." </p>
                  <p>Hilda took a quick, soft breath. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big,
                    determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash. </p>
                  <p>"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice. </p>
                  <p>He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to
                    the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a
                    street vendor began to call under the window. At last Alexander brought out one
                    word:&#8212; </p>
                  <p>"Everything!" </p>
                  <p>Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright. She looked about
                    desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to
                    Bartley. She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back
                    upon her stool. </p>
                  <p>"I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously. "I can't stand
                    seeing you miserable." </p>
                  <p>"I can't live with myself any longer," he answered roughly. </p>
                  <p>He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the
                    room, seeming to find it too small for him. He pulled up a window as if the air
                    were heavy. </p>
                  <p>Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows
                    growing about her eyes. </p>
                  <p>"It . . . it has n't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her
                    lips quivered. </p>
                  <p>"Always. But it's worse now. It's unbearable. It tortures me every minute." </p>
                  <p>"But why <hi rend="italic">now?</hi>" she asked piteously, wringing her hands. </p>
                  <p>He ignored her question. "I am not a man who can live two lives," he went on
                    feverishly. "Each life spoils the other. I get nothing but misery out of either.
                    The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
                    There is this deception between me and everything." </p>
                  <p>At that word "deception," spoken with such self-contempt, the color
                    flashed back into Hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck
                    by a whiplash. She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped
                    tightly in front of her. </p>
                  <p>"Could you&#8212;could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if
                    I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?" </p>
                  <p>He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire. "It was myself I was defying,
                    Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out." </p>
                  <p>He looked at her and his haggard face softened. He put out his hand toward her as
                    he looked away again into the fire. </p>
                  <p>She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her. "When did you first begin
                    to feel like this, Bartley?" </p>
                  <p>"After the very first. The first was&#8212;sort of in play, was n't it?" </p>
                  <p>Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been. But
                    why did n't you tell me when you were here in the summer?" </p>
                  <p>Alexander groaned. "I meant to, but somehow I could n't. We had only a few days,
                    and your new play was just on, and you were so happy." </p>
                  <p>"Yes, I was happy, was n't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Were
                    n't you happy then, at all?" </p>
                  <p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance
                    of those days. Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander,
                    too. He moved uneasily and his chair creaked. </p>
                  <p>"Yes, I was then. You know. But afterward . . . " </p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it
                    stole back to his coat sleeve. "Please tell me one thing, Bartley. At least,
                    tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy." </p>
                  <p>His hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeve. "Yes,
                    Hilda; I know that," he said simply. </p>
                  <p>She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:&#8212; </p>
                  <p>"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything. I wanted you to eat
                    all the cakes and have them, too. I somehow believed that I could take all the
                    bad consequences for you. I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and
                    successful&#8212;to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and,
                    once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted." </p>
                  <p>Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening
                    lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle
                    together. </p>
                  <p>"I understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I did n't know. You've only to tell me
                    now. What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened
                    intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair. "You want me to
                    say it?" she whispered. "You want to tell me that you can only see me like this,
                    as old friends do, or out in the world among people? I can do that." </p>
                  <p>"I can't," he said heavily. </p>
                  <p>Hilda shivered and sat still. Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke
                    through his teeth. "It's got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can't see you at all,
                    anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no
                    matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg." </p>
                  <p>Hilda sprang up like a flame. She stood over him with her hands
                    clenched at her side, her body rigid. </p>
                  <p>"No!" she gasped. "It's too late to ask that. Do you hear me, Bartley? It's too
                    late. I won't promise. It's abominable of you to ask me. Keep away if you wish;
                    when have I ever followed you? But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit. The
                    shamefulness of your asking me to do that! If you come to me, I'll do as I see
                    fit. Do you understand? Bartley, you're cowardly!" </p>
                  <p>Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. "Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid
                    of myself. I don't trust myself any more. I carried it all lightly enough at
                    first, but now I don't dare trifle with it. It's getting the better of
                    me. It's different now. I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here
                    with you. It's through him that I've come to wish for you all and all the time."
                    He took her roughly in his arms. "Do you know what I mean?" </p>
                  <p>Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly. "Oh, Bartley, what
                    am I to do? Why did n't you let me be angry with you? You ask me to stay away
                    from you because you want me! And I've got nobody but you. I will do anything
                    you say&#8212;but that! I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have
                        <hi rend="italic">something!</hi>" </p>
                  <p>Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again. Hilda sat on the arm of it
                    and put her hands lightly on his shoulders. </p>
                  <p>"Just something, Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months and
                    months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The sight of you,
                    Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful&#8212;can I never make
                    you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently. "You
                    see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different. If I'd met
                    you later, if I had n't loved you so well&#8212;but that's all over, long
                    ago. Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged;
                    those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding&#8212; hard as
                    a steel spring. And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no
                    difference." </p>
                  <p>She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up
                    any longer. Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and
                    her wet, tired eyes. </p>
                  <p>"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered. "We've tortured each other enough for
                    to-night. Forget everything except that I am here." </p>
                  <p>"I think I have forgotten everything but that already," she murmured. "Ah, your
                    dear arms!" </p>

                    hard. He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great many men
                    who were doing interesting things in his own profession. He disliked to think of
                    his visits to London as holidays, and when he was there he worked even harder
                    than he did at home. </p>
                  <p>The day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one. The thick
                    air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a golden dawn and
                    then fell off to a fresh breeze. When Bartley looked out of his windows from the
                    Savoy, the river was flashing silver and the gray stone along the
                    Embankment was bathed in bright, clear sunshine. London had wakened to life
                    after three weeks of cold and sodden rain. Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and
                    went over his mail while the hotel valet packed his trunks. Then he paid his
                    account and walked rapidly down <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r123" target="en123">the Strand past</ref>
                     <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r124" target="en124">Charing Cross Station</ref>. His
                    spirits rose with every step, and when he reached <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r125" target="en125">Trafalgar Square</ref>, blazing in
                    the sun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the bright air, he signaled to
                    a hansom, and, before he knew what he was about, told the driver to go to
                    Bedford Square by way of the British Museum. </p>
                  <p>When he reached Hilda's apartment she met him, fresh as the morning itself. Her
                    rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he
                    had been sending her. She would never let him give her anything else. </p>
                  <p>"Are you busy this morning, Hilda?" he asked as he sat down, his hat and gloves
                    in his hand. </p>
                  <p>"Very. I've been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open in
                    February, you know." </p>
                  <p>"Well, then you've worked enough. And so have I. I've seen all my men, my packing
                    is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening. But this morning we are going to
                    have a holiday. What do you say to a drive out to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r126" target="en126">Kew and Richmond</ref>? You may not
                    get another day like this all winter. It's like a fine April day at home. May I
                    use your telephone? I want to order the carriage." </p>
                  <p>"Oh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are telephoning I'll
                    change my dress. I shan't be long. All the morning papers are on the table." </p>
                  <p>Hilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a broad fur
                    hat. Bartley rose and inspected her. "Why don't you wear some of those pink
                    roses?" he asked. </p>
                  <p>"But they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open. I was
                    saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!" She laughed as she looked about the
                    room. "You've been sending me far too many flowers, Bartley. New ones
                    every day. That's too often; though I do love to open the boxes, and I take good
                    care of them." </p>
                  <p>"Why won't you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you are so fond
                    of ? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures." </p>
                  <p>Hilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass. "No, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r127" target="en127">there
                    are some things you can't do</ref>. There's the carriage. Will you button my gloves
                    for me?" </p>
                  <p>Bartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove. "How gay
                    your eyes are this morning, Hilda." </p>
                  <p>"That's because I've been studying. It always stirs me up a little." </p>
                  <p>He pushed the top of the glove up slowly. "When did you learn to take hold of
                    your parts like that?" </p>
                  <p>"When I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting. What a
                    shocking while you take." </p>
                  <p>"I'm in no hurry. We've plenty of time." </p>
                  <p>They found all London abroad. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r128" target="en128">Piccadilly</ref> was a stream of rapidly moving carriages, from which flashed furs and
                    flowers and bright winter costumes. The metal trappings of the
                    harnesses shone dazzingly, and the wheels were revolving disks that threw off
                    rays of light. The parks were full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs
                    that leaped and yelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws. </p>
                  <p>"I'm not going until to-morrow, you know," Bartley announced suddenly. "I'll cut
                    off a day in Liverpool. I have n't felt so jolly this long while." </p>
                  <p>Hilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad. "I think
                    people were meant to be happy, a little," she said. </p>
                  <p>They had lunch at Richmond and then walked to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r129" target="en129">Twickenham</ref>, where they had sent the
                    carriage. They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind them, toward the
                    distant gold-washed city. It was one of those rare afternoons when all the
                    thickness and shadow of London are changed to a kind of shining, pulsing,
                    special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors become fluttering golden
                    clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when all that bleakness of gray stone
                    and dullness of dirty brick trembles in aureate light, and all the roofs and
                    spires, and one great dome, are floated in golden haze. On such rare
                    afternoons the ugliest of cities becomes the most beautiful, the most prosaic becomes the most poetic, and months of
                    sodden days are offset by a moment of miracle. </p>
                  <p>"It's like that with us Londoners, too," Hilda was saying. "Everything is awfully
                    grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways of amusing
                    ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r130" target="en130">We can go mad with joy, as the
                        people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday</ref>. We make the most of our
                    moment." </p>
                  <p>She thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and Bartley
                    looked down at her and laughed. </p>
                  <p>"You are a plucky one, you." He patted her glove with his hand. "Yes, you are a
                    plucky one." </p>
                  <p>Hilda sighed. "No, I'm not. Not about some things, at any rate. It does n't take
                    pluck to fight for one's moment, but it takes pluck to go without&#8212;a
                    lot. More than I have. I can't help it," she added fiercely. </p>
                  <p>After miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached London
                    itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming up from the
                    river, that betokened fog again to-morrow. The streets were full of people who
                    had worked indoors all through the priceless day and had now come hungrily out
                    to drink the muddy lees of it. They stood in long black lines, waiting before the pit entrances of the theatres&#8212;short-coated boys, 
                    and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and chatting gayly. There was a blurred
                    rhythm in all the dull city noises&#8212;in the clatter of the cab horses
                    and the rumbling of the busses, in the street calls, and in the undulating
                    tramp, tramp of the crowd. It was like the deep vibration of some vast
                    underground machinery, and like the muffled pulsations of millions of
                    human hearts. </p>
                  <p>"Seems good to get back, does n't it?" Bartley whispered, as they drove from
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r131" target="en131">Bayswater Road</ref> into <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r132" target="en132">Oxford Street</ref>. "London always makes me want to live more
                    than any other city in the world. You remember <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r133" target="en133">our priestess mummy over in the
                    mummy-room</ref>, and how we used to long to go and bring her out on nights like this?
                    Three thousand years! Ugh!" </p>
                  <p>"All the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and watched her
                    and wished her well. I believe she used to remember," Hilda said thoughtfully. </p>
                  <p>"I hope so. Now let's go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before we go
                    home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night. Where shall I
                    tell the driver? The <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r134" target="en134">Piccadilly Restaurant</ref>? The music's good there." </p>
                  <p>"There are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little French place in <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r135" target="en135">Soho</ref>, where we went so often when you were
                    here in the summer? I love it, and I've never been there with any one but you.
                    Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely." </p>
                  <p>"Very well, the sole's good there. How many <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r136" target="en136">street pianos</ref> there are about
                    to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We've had five miles of
                            <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r137" target="en137">'Il Trovatore'</ref> now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are you comfy, and not too
                    tired?" </p>
                  <p>"I'm not tired at all. I was just wondering how people can ever die. Why did you
                    remind me of the mummy? Life seems the strongest and most indestructible thing
                    in the world. Do you really believe that all those people rushing about down
                    there, going to good dinners and clubs and theatres, will be dead some day, and
                    not care about anything? I don't believe it, and I know I shan't die, ever! You
                    see, I feel too&#8212;too powerful!" </p>
                  <p>The carriage stopped. Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the pavement.
                    As he lifted her in his two hands he whispered: "You are&#8212;powerful!" </p>

                  <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> last rehearsal was over, a tedious dress rehearsal which had
                    lasted all day and exhausted the patience of everyone who had to do with it.
                    When Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her dressing-room, she
                    found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the corridor. </p>
                  <p>"The fog's thicker than ever, Hilda. There have been a great many accidents
                    to-day. It's positively unsafe for you to be out alone. Will you let me take you
                    home?" </p>
                  <p>"How good of you, Mac. If you are going with me, I think I'd rather walk. I've
                    had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous." </p>
                  <p>"I should n't wonder," said MacConnell dryly. Hilda pulled down her veil and they
                    stepped out into the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r138" target="en138">thick brown wash</ref> that submerged <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r139" target="en139">St. Martin's Lane</ref>.
                    MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his arm. "I'm sorry I was
                    such a savage. I hope you did n't think I made an ass of myself." </p>
                  <p>"Not a bit of it. I don't wonder you were peppery. Those things are awfully trying. How do you think it's going?" </p>
                  <p>"Magnificently. That's why I got so stirred up. We are going to hear from this,
                    both of us. And that reminds me; I've got news for you. They are going to begin
                    repairs on the theatre about the middle of March, and we are to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r140" target="en140">run over to New
                    York for six weeks</ref>. Bennett told me yesterday that it was decided." </p>
                  <p>Hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her. He was the only
                    thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense opaqueness, as if they
                    were walking at the bottom of the ocean. </p>
                  <p>"Oh, Mac, how glad I am! And they love your things over there, don't they?" </p>
                  <p>"Shall you be glad for&#8212;any other reason, Hilda?" </p>
                  <p>MacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object. It proved
                    to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the edge of the pavement. </p>
                  <p>"What do you mean, Mac?" Hilda asked nervously. </p>
                  <p>"I was just thinking there might be people over there you'd be glad to see," he
                    brought out awkwardly. Hilda said nothing, and as they walked on MacConnell
                    spoke again, apologetically: "I hope you don't mind my knowing about it, Hilda.
                    Don't stiffen up like that. No one else knows, and I did n't try to find out
                    anything. I felt it, even before I knew who he was. I knew there was somebody, and that it was n't I." </p>
                  <p>They crossed <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r141" target="en141">Oxford Street</ref> in silence, feeling their way. The busses had stopped
                    running and the cabdrivers were leading their horses. When they reached the
                    other side, MacConnell said suddenly, "I hope you are happy." </p>
                  <p>"Terribly, dangerously happy, Mac,"&#8212;Hilda spoke quietly, pressing the
                    rough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand. </p>
                  <p>"You've always thought me too old for you, Hilda,&#8212; oh, of course you've
                    never said just that,&#8212;and here this fellow is not more than eight
                    years younger than I. I've always felt that if I could get out of my old case I
                    might win you yet. It's a fine, brave youth I carry inside me, only he'll never
                    be seen." </p>
                  <p>"Nonsense, Mac. That has nothing to do with it. It's because you seem too close
                    to me, too much my own kind. It would be like marrying Cousin Mike, almost. I
                    really tried to care as you wanted me to, away back in the beginning." </p>
                  <p>"Well, here we are, turning out of the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r142" target="en142">Square</ref>. You are not angry with me, Hilda?
                    Thank you for this walk, my dear. Go in and get dry things on at once. You'll be
                    having a great night to-morrow." </p>
                  <p>She put out her hand. "Thank you, Mac, for everything. Good-night." </p>
                  <p>MacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs. Her
                    slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire. "I shall
                    certainly see him in New York. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r143" target="en143">He will see by the papers that we are coming</ref>.
                    Perhaps he knows it already," Hilda kept thinking as she undressed. "Perhaps he
                    will be at the dock. No, scarcely that; but I may meet him in the street even
                    before he comes to see me." Marie placed the tea-table by the fire and brought
                    Hilda her letters. She looked them over, and started as she came to one in a
                    handwriting that she did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice
                    before, and he did not allow her to write to him at all. "Thank you, Marie. You
                    may go now." </p>
                  <p>Hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still unopened. She
                    looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its thickness with her fingers.
                    She believed that she sometimes had a kind of second-sight about letters, and
                    could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings. She
                    put this one down on the table in front of her while she poured her tea. At
                    last, with a little shiver of expectancy, she tore open the envelope and
                    read:&#8212;

                    Happiness like that makes one insolent. I used to think these four walls could
                    stand against anything. And now I scarcely know myself here. Now I know that no
                    one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person. Two people,
                    when they love each other, grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but
                    their moral natures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never
                    welded. The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to the end. </p>
                              <p>The last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used to be
                    with me. Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it has been as if
                    a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all the smells of spring blew
                    in to me. There is a garden out there, with stars overhead, where I used to walk
                    at night when I had a single purpose and a single heart. I can remember how I
                    used to feel there, how beautiful everything about me was, and what life and
                    power and freedom I felt in myself. When the window opens I know exactly how it
                    would feel to be out there. But that garden is closed to me. How is it, I ask myself, that everything can be so
                    different with me when nothing here has changed? I am in my own house, in my own
                    study, in the midst of all these quiet streets where my friends live. They are
                    all safe and at peace with themselves. But I am never at peace. I feel always on
                    the edge of danger and change. </p>
                              <p>I keep remembering <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r144" target="en144">locoed horses</ref> I used to see on the range when I was a boy.
                    They changed like that. We used to catch them and put them up in the corral, and
                    they developed great cunning. They would pretend to eat their oats like the
                    other horses, but we knew they were always scheming to get back at the loco. </p>
                              <p>It seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world. When he tries
                    to live a second, he develops another nature. I feel as if a second man had been
                    grafted into me. At first he seemed only a pleasure-loving simpleton, of whose
                    company I was rather ashamed, and whom I used to hide under my coat when I
                    walked the Embankment, in London. But now he is strong and sullen, and he is
                    fighting for his life at the cost of mine. That is his one activity: to grow
                    strong. No creature ever wanted so much to live. Eventually, I suppose, he will
                    absorb me altogether. Believe me, you will hate me then. </p>
                              <p>And what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story? </p>
                              <p>Nothing at all. The little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r145" target="en145">he became a stag</ref>. I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and
                    because it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer. And because I suffer,
                    Hilda. If any one I loved suffered like this, I'd want to know it. Help me,
                    Hilda! </p>

                     <p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the last Saturday in April, the New York "Times" published an account
                    of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander's New Jersey bridge,
                    and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r146" target="en146">West Tenth
                    Street</ref>. </p>
                     <p>On Sunday, the day after this notice appeared, Alexander worked all day at his
                    Tenth Street rooms. His business often called him to New York, and he had kept
                    an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length
                    of time. Besides his sleeping-room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a
                    painter's studio, which he used as a study and office. It was furnished with the
                    cast-off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered
                    for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings.
                    Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror. Alexander's big
                    work-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung
                    the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r147" target="en147">a study
                    of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since
                    become a portrait-painter of international renown</ref>. He had done it for Alexander
                    when they were students together in Paris. </p>
                  </div2>
                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>Sunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously. When Alexander came
                    back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and
                    settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets. It was
                    after nine o'clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a
                    sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his
                    hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap. He rose and crossed
                    the room quickly. When he threw open the door he recognized the figure that
                    shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway. He stood for a moment in awkward
                    constraint, his pipe in his hand. </p>
                     <p>"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her. He pointed
                    to a chair by the fire and went back to his work-table. "Won't you sit down?" </p>
                     <p>He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously.
                    The yellow light from the student's lamp fell on his hands and the purple
                    sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were in the shadow. There was something about him that made Hilda wish
                    herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was. </p>
                     <p>"Of course I know, Bartley," she said at last, "that after this you won't owe me
                    the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw that interview in the
                    paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you. That's
                    all. Good-night; I'm going now." She turned and her hand closed on the
                    door-knob. </p>
                     <p>Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm. "Sit down, Hilda;
                    you're wet through. Let me take off your coat&#8212;and your boots; they're
                    oozing water." He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank
                    into the chair. "Here, put your feet on this stool. You don't mean to say you
                    walked down&#8212; and without overshoes!" </p>
                     <p>Hilda hid her face in her hands. "I was afraid to take a cab. Can't you see,
                    Bartley, that I'm terribly frightened? I've been through this a hundred times
                    to-day. Don't be any more angry than you can help. I was all right until I knew
                    you were in town. If you'd sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything! But
                    you won't let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that
                    terrible letter you wrote me when you got home." </p>
                     <p>Alexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and began to brush the sleeve of his jacket. "Is this the way you
                    mean to answer it, Hilda?" he asked unsteadily. </p>
                     <p>She was afraid to look up at him. "Did n't&#8212; did n't you mean even to
                    say good-by to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to&#8212;quit me?" she asked.
                    "I came to tell you that I'm willing to do as you asked me. But it's no use
                    talking about that now. Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r148" target="en148">the fender</ref>. </p>
                     <p>Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair. "Did you think I had forgotten you
                    were in town, Hilda? Do you think I kept away by accident? Did you suppose I did n't know you were sailing on Tuesday? There is a letter for you there, in my
                    desk drawer. It was to have reached you on the steamer. I was all the morning
                    writing it. I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of
                    myself, a letter would be better than nothing. Marks on paper mean something to
                    you." He paused. "They never did to me." </p>
                     <p>Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve. "Oh, Bartley!
                    Did you write to me? Why did n't you telephone me to let me know that you had?
                    Then I would n't have come." </p>
                     <p>Alexander slipped his arm about her. "I did n't know it before, Hilda, on my
                    honor I did n't, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just
                    this. I've watched that door all day. I've jumped up if the fire crackled. I
                    think I have felt that you were coming." He bent his face over her hair. </p>
                     <p>"And I," she whispered,&#8212;"I felt that you were feeling that. But when I
                    came, I thought I had been mistaken." </p>
                     <p>Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room. </p>
                     <p>"No, you were n't mistaken. I've been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged
                    not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when your manager added
                    two more weeks, I was already committed." He dropped upon the stool in front of
                    her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees. "What am I to do, Hilda?" </p>
                     <p>"That's what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I'm going to do what you asked
                    me to do, when you were in London. Only I'll do it more completely.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="r149" target="en149"> I'm going to
                    marry</ref>." </p>
                     <p>"Who?" </p>
                     <p>"Oh, it does n't matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I'm too fond of him." </p>
                     <p>Alexander moved restlessly. "Are you joking, Hilda?" </p>
                     <p>"Indeed I'm not." </p>
                     <p>"Then you don't know what you're talking about." </p>
                     <p>"Yes, I know very well. I've thought about it a great deal, and I've quite
                    decided. I never used to understand how women did things like that, but I know
                    now. It's because they can't be at the mercy of the man they love any longer." </p>
                     <p>Alexander flushed angrily. "So it's better to be at the mercy of a man
                    you don't love?" </p>
                     <p>"Under such circumstances, infinitely!" </p>
                     <p>There was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander's fall. He got up and
                    went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out. He heard Hilda moving
                    about behind him. When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots. He
                    went back and stood over her. </p>
                     <p>"Hilda, you'd better think a while longer before you do that. I don't know what I
                    ought to say, but I don't believe you'd be happy; truly I don't. Are n't you
                    trying to frighten me?" </p>
                     <p>She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly. "No; I'm
                    telling you what I've made up my mind to do. I suppose I would better do it
                    without telling you. But afterward I shan't have an opportunity to explain, for
                    I shan't be seeing you again." </p>
                     <p>Alexander started to speak, but caught himself. When Hilda rose he sat down on
                    the arm of her chair and drew her back into it. </p>
                     <p>"I would n't be so much alarmed if I did n't know how utterly reckless you <hi rend="italic">can
                   </hi> be. Don't do anything like that rashly." His face grew troubled. "You would n't be happy. You are not that kind of woman. I'd never have another hour's
                    peace if I helped to make you do a thing like that." He took her face between
                    his hands and looked down into it. "You see, you are different, Hilda. Don't you
                    know you are?" His voice grew softer, his touch more and more tender. "Some
                    women can do that sort of thing, but you&#8212;you can love as queens did,
                    in the old time." </p>
                     <p>Hilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before. She closed
                    her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled. "Only one, Bartley. Only one. And he
                    threw it back at me a second time." </p>
                     <p>She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly. </p>
                     <p>"Try him again, Hilda. Try him once again." </p>
                     <p>She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands. </p>

                     <p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in
                    Vermont, was standing on the siding at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r150" target="en150">White River Junction</ref> when the Canadian
                    Express pulled by on its northward journey. As the day-coaches at the rear end
                    of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at one of the windows a man's
                    head, with thick rumpled hair. "Curious," he thought; "that looked like
                    Alexander, but what would he be doing back there in the day-coaches?" </p>
                     <p>It was, indeed, Alexander. </p>
                     <p>That morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that there was
                    serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there at once, so he had
                    caught the first train out of New York. He had taken a seat in a day-coach to
                    avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and because he did not wish to be
                    comfortable. When the telegram arrived, Alexander was at his rooms on Tenth
                    Street, packing his bag to go to Boston. On Monday night he had written a long
                    letter to his wife, but when morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter was still in his pocket. Winifred was not a woman who could bear
                    disappointment. She demanded a great deal of herself and of the people she
                    loved; and she never failed herself. If he told her now, he knew, it would be
                    irretrievable. There would be no going back. He would lose the thing he valued
                    most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own happiness. There
                    would be nothing for him afterward. He seemed to see himself dragging out a
                    restless existence on the Continent&#8212;<ref type="editorial" xml:id="r151" target="en151">Cannes</ref>, <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r152" target="en152">Hy&#232;res</ref>,

                    nationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to catch
                    trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning with a great
                    bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no purpose and no
                    meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late to shorten the day. </p>
                     <p>And for what? For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he could not
                    let go. <hi rend="italic">And he could even let it go,</hi> he told himself. But he had promised
                    to be in London at midsummer, and he knew that he would go. . . . It was
                    impossible to live like this any longer. </p>
                     <p>And this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had foreseen for
                    him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust. And he could not
                    understand how it had come about. He felt that he himself was unchanged, that he
                    was still there, the same man he had been five years ago, and that he was
                    sitting stupidly by and letting some resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life
                    for him. This new force was not he, it was but a part of him. He would not even
                    admit that it was stronger than he; but it was more active. It was by its energy
                    that this new feeling got the better of him. His wife was the woman who had made
                    his life, gratified his pride, given direction to his tastes and habits. The
                    life they led together seemed to him beautiful. Winifred still was, as she had
                    always been, Romance for him, and whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to
                    her. When the grandeur and beauty of the world challenged him&#8212; as it
                    challenges even the most self-absorbed people&#8212; he always answered with
                    her name. That was his reply to the question put by the mountains and the stars;
                    to all the spiritual aspects of life. In his feeling for his wife there was all
                    the tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was capable. There
                    was everything but energy; the energy of youth which must register itself and
                    cut its name before it passes. This new feeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and
                    light of foot. It ran and was not wearied, anticipated him everywhere. It put <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r156" target="en156">a
                    girdle round the earth</ref> while he was going from New York to Moorlock. At this moment, it was tingling through him, exultant, and live as
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r157" target="en157">quicksilver</ref>, whispering, "In July you will be in England." </p>
                     <p>Already he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish coast, the
                    sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train through
                    the summer country. He closed his eyes and gave himself up to the feeling of
                    rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts. He was sitting so, his face
                    shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him from the siding at White
                    River Junction. </p>
                     <p>When at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to sunset. The
                    train was passing through a gray country and the sky overhead was
                    flushed with a wide flood of clear color. There was a
                    rose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows. Off to the left,
                    under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a group of boys were
                    sitting around a little fire. The smell of the wood smoke blew in at the window.
                    Except for an old farmer, jogging along the highroad in his box-wagon, there was
                    not another living creature to be seen. Alexander looked back wistfully at the
                    boys, camped on the edge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and
                    looking gravely at their fire. They took his mind back a long way, to a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r158" target="en158">campfire
                        on a sandbar in a Western river</ref>, and he wished he could go back and sit down with them. He could
                    remember exactly how the world had looked then. </p>
                     <p>It was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it occurred
                    to him that the train must be nearing Allway. In going to his new bridge at
                    Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway. The train stopped at <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r159" target="en159">Allway
                    Mills</ref>, then wound two miles up the river, and then the hollow sound under his
                    feet told Bartley that he was on his first bridge again. The bridge seemed
                    longer than it had ever seemed before, and he was glad when he felt the beat of
                    the wheels on the solid roadbed again. He did not like coming and going across
                    that bridge, or remembering the man who built it. And was he, indeed, the same
                    man who used to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and
                    to the stars? And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet hills
                    sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge reaching out into
                    the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big white house; upstairs, in
                    Winifred's window, the light that told him she was still awake and still
                    thinking of him. And after the light went out he walked alone, taking the
                    heavens into his confidence, unable to tear himself away from the white magic of
                    the night, unwilling to sleep because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time since first the hills were
                    hung with moonlight, there was a lover in the world. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r160" target="en160">And always there was the
                    sound of the rushing water underneath, the sound which, more than anything else,
                    meant death; the wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces
                    which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish. Then, in the exaltation
                    of love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other thing as
                    strong as love. Under the moon, under the cold, splendid stars, there were only
                    those two things awake and sleepless; death and love, the rushing river and his
                    burning heart</ref>. </p>
                     <p>Alexander sat up and looked about him. The train was tearing on through the
                    darkness. All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or sleeping
                    heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low. How came he here among all these
                    dirty people? Why was he going to London? What did it mean&#8212;what was
                    the answer? How could this happen to a man who had lived through that magical
                    spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars themselves were but
                    flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of his love? </p>
                     <p>What had he done to lose it? How could he endure the baseness of life without it?
                    And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the unquiet quicksilver in his breast told him that at midsummer he would be in London. He remembered his
                    last night there: the red foggy darkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres,
                    the hand-organs, the feverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the
                    feeling of letting himself go with the crowd. He shuddered and looked about him
                    at the poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and travel-stained,
                    now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to stand to him for the ugliness
                    he had brought into the world. </p>
                     <p>And those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he wished he
                    could promise them better luck. Ah, if one could promise any one better luck, if
                    one could assure a single human being of happiness! He had thought he could do
                    so, once; and it was thinking of that that he at last fell asleep. In his sleep,
                    as if it had nothing fresher to work upon, his mind went back and tortured
                    itself with something years and years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his
                    childhood. </p>
                     <p>When Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through pale golden
                    ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating through the pine
                    woods. The <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r161" target="en161">white birches</ref>, with their little unfolding leaves, gleamed in the
                    lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already coming to life with their first
                    green, a thin, bright color which had run over them like fire. As the train rushed along
                    the trestles, thousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light. The sky was
                    already a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal. Bartley caught up his bag
                    and hurried through the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r162" target="en162">Pullman coaches</ref> until he found the conductor. There was
                    a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set about changing his clothes. Last
                    night he would not have believed that anything could be so pleasant as the cold
                    water he dashed over his head and shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on
                    his body. </p>
                     <p>After he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into his lungs
                    deep breaths of the pine-scented air. He had awakened with all his old sense of
                    power. He could not believe that things were as bad with him as they had seemed
                    last night, that there was no way to set them entirely right. Even if he went to
                    London at midsummer, what would that mean except that he was a fool? And he had
                    been a fool before. That was not the reality of his life. Yet he knew that he
                    would go to London. </p>
                     <p>Half an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock. Alexander sprang to the
                    platform and hurried up the siding, waving to <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r163" target="en163">Philip Horton, one of his
                    assistants</ref>, who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the coaches. Bartley took his arm and they went together into the station buffet. </p>
                     <p>"I'll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what seems to be
                    the matter up here?" </p>
                     <p>The young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation. </p>
                     <p>But Alexander cut him short. "When did you stop work?" he asked sharply. </p>
                     <p>The young engineer looked confused. "I have n't stopped work yet, Mr. Alexander.
                    I did n't feel that I could go so far without definite authorization from you." </p>
                     <p>"Then why did n't you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and ask for
                    your authorization? You'd have got it quick enough." </p>
                     <p>"Well, really, Mr. Alexander, I could n't be absolutely sure, you know, and I did n't like to take the responsibility of making it public." </p>
                     <p>Alexander pushed back his chair and rose. "Anything I do can be made public,
                    Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing strain, and that
                    even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet you've gone on adding
                    weight." </p>
                     <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here yesterday. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r164" target="en164">My
                    first telegram missed you somehow</ref>. I sent one Sunday evening, to the same address, but it was returned to
                    me." </p>
                     <p>"Have you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire." </p>
                     <p>Alexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following message to his
                    wife:&#8212; </p>
                     <p>I may have to be here for some time. Can you come up at once? Urgent. </p>
                     <p>Bartley. </p>
                     <p>The Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town. When they were seated in the
                    carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant further. If it were true
                    that the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r165" target="en165">compression members</ref> showed strain, with the bridge only two thirds
                    done, then there was <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r166" target="en166">nothing to do but pull the whole structure down and begin
                    over again</ref>. Horton kept repeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong
                    with the estimates. </p>
                     <p>Alexander grew impatient. "That's all true, Phil, but we never were justified in
                    assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an ordinary bridge would work
                    with anything of such length. It's all very well on paper, but it remains to be
                    seen whether it can be done in practice. I should have thrown up the job when
                    they crowded me. It's all nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing
                    when you know they're not sound." </p>
                     <p>"But just now, when there is such competition," the younger man demurred. "And
                    certainly that's the new line of development." </p>
                     <p>Alexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. </p>
                     <p>When they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination immediately.
                    An hour later he sent for the superintendent. "I think you had better stop work
                    out there at once, Dan. I should say that the lower chord here might buckle at
                    any moment. I told <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r167" target="en167">the Commission</ref> that we were using higher unit stresses than
                    any practice has established, and we've put the dead load at a low estimate.
                    <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r168" target="en168">Theoretically it worked out well enough, but it had never actually been tried</ref>."
                    Alexander put on his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm. "Don't
                    look so <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r169" target="en169">chopfallen</ref>, Dan. It's a jolt, but we've got to face it. It is n't the
                    end of the world, you know. Now we'll go out and call the men off quietly.
                    They're already nervous, Horton tells me, and there's no use alarming them. I'll
                    go with you, and we'll send the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r170" target="en170">end riveters</ref> in first." </p>
                     <p>Alexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the long span.
                    They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was doing, as if they
                    were on an ordinary round of inspection. When they reached the end of the river
                    span, Alexander nodded to the superintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman. The men in the end
                    gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each other, started back
                    across the bridge toward the river-bank. Alexander himself remained standing
                    where they had been working, looking about him. It was hard to believe, as he
                    looked back over it, that the whole great span was incurably disabled, was
                    already as good as condemned, because something was out of line in the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r171" target="en171">lower
                    chord of the cantilever arm</ref>. </p>
                     <p>The end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the tool-houses,
                    and the second gang had picked up their tools and were starting toward the
                    shore. Alexander, still standing at the end of the river span, saw the lower
                    chord of the cantilever arm give a little, like an elbow bending. He shouted and
                    ran after the second gang, but by this time every one knew that the big river
                    span was slowly settling. There was a burst of shouting that was immediately
                    drowned by the scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work
                    began to pull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of
                    tons of iron-work, all riveted together and lying in midair without support. It
                    tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises that were like the
                    shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of any kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own
                    weight. It lurched neither to right nor left, but <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r172" target="en172">sank almost in a vertical
                    line</ref>, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part
                    could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of the men
                    jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore. </p>
                     <p>At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the downstream
                    side of the bridge. He struck the water without injury and disappeared. He was
                    under the river a long time and had great difficulty in holding his breath. When
                    it seemed impossible, and his chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his
                    wife telling him that he could hold out a little longer. An instant later his
                    face cleared the water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had
                    realized what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last
                    abandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew he should
                    live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at last, he felt sure of
                    himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him that he had been through
                    something of this sort before. There was nothing horrible about it. This, too,
                    was life, and life was activity, just as it was in Boston or in London. He was
                    himself, and there was something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural. Alexander was a strong swimmer, but he had
                    gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the bridge itself, which had been settling
                    faster and faster, crashed into the water behind him. Immediately the river was
                    full of drowning men. A gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He
                    thought he had cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching
                    at him and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either hurt or
                    crazed with fright. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r173" target="en173">Alexander tried to beat them off</ref>, but there were too many of
                    them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped him about the middle, and
                    they went down together. When he sank, his wife seemed to be there in the water
                    beside him, telling him to keep his head, that if he could hold out the men
                    would drown and release him. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but
                    he could not think clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered
                    what it was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go. </p>

                  <div2 type="section">
                     <p>The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following night. By
                    the next morning <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r174" target="en174">forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the river, but there
                        were still twenty missing</ref>. Many of the men had fallen with the bridge and were
                    held down under the d&#233;bris. Early on the morning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the
                    river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled and
                    churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line two thirds
                    across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and word soon spread among
                    the crowds on the shore that its occupant was the wife of the <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r175" target="en175">Chief Engineer</ref>;
                    his body had not yet been found. The widows of the lost workmen, moving up and
                    down the bank with shawls over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked
                    at the rusty hired hack many times that morning. They drew near it and walked
                    about it, but none of them ventured to peer within. Even half-indifferent
                    sight-seers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: "You see that carriage
                    over there? That's Mrs. Alexander. They have n't found him yet. She got off the
                    train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in Boston
                    yesterday&#8212;heard the newsboys crying it in the street." </p>
                     <p>At noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a tin
                    coffee-pot from the camp kitchen. When he reached the carriage he found Mrs.
                    Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning, leaning forward a
                    little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking at the river. Hour after
                    hour she had been watching the water, the lonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed mass
                    of iron wreckage over which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam. </p>
                     <p>"Those poor women out there, do they blame him very much?" she asked, as she
                    handed the coffee-cup back to Horton. </p>
                     <p>"Nobody blames him, Mrs. Alexander. If any one is to blame, I'm afraid it's I. I
                    should have stopped work before he came. He said so as soon as I met him. I
                    tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram missed him, somehow. He did n't have time really to explain to me. If he'd got here Monday, he'd have had
                    all the men off at once. But, you see, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never
                    happened before. According to all human calculations, it simply could n't
                    happen." </p>
                     <p>Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not had his
                    clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent excitement was
                    beginning to wear off. </p>
                     <p>"Don't be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don't leave me to the dread of
                    finding out things that people may be saying. If he is blamed, if he needs any
                    one to speak for him,"&#8212;for the first time her voice broke and a
                    flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept over her rigid
                    pallor,&#8212;"if he needs any one, tell me, show me what to do." She began to sob, and Horton hurried away. </p>
                     <p>When he came back at four o'clock in the afternoon he was carrying his hat in his
                    hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had found Bartley. She
                    opened the carriage door before he reached her and stepped to the ground. </p>
                     <p>Horton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly: "Won't you
                    drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up there." </p>
                     <p>"Take me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble." </p>
                     <p>The group of men down under the river-bank fell back when they saw a woman
                    coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher. They took off
                    their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although she had pulled her veil
                    down over her face they did not look up at her. She was taller than Horton, and
                    some of the men thought she was the tallest woman they had ever seen. "As tall
                    as himself," some one whispered. Horton motioned to the men, and six of them
                    lifted the stretcher and began to carry it up the embankment. Winifred followed
                    them the half-mile to Horton's house. She walked quietly, without once breaking
                    or stumbling. When the bearers put the stretcher down in Horton's spare bedroom, she thanked them and gave her hand to each in turn.
                    The men went out of the house and through the yard with their caps in their
                    hands. They were too much confused to say anything as they went down the hill. </p>
                     <p>Horton himself was almost as deeply perplexed. "Mamie," he said to his wife, when
                    he came out of the spare room half an hour later, "will you take Mrs. Alexander
                    the things she needs? She is going to do everything herself. Just stay about
                    where you can hear her and go in if she wants you." </p>
                     <p>Everything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of prescience under
                    the river. With her own hands she washed him clean of every mark of disaster.
                    All night he was alone with her in the still house, his great head lying deep in
                    the pillow. In the pocket of his coat Winifred found the letter that he had
                    written her the night before he left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but
                    because of its length, she knew it had been meant for her. </p>
                     <p>For Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled upon him
                    consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r176" target="en176">His harshest critics
                        did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have retrieved himself</ref>. Even Lucius
                    Wilson did not see in this accident the disaster he had once foretold. </p>
                     <p>When a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say whether he did
                    well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to be. The mind that
                    society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable machine, dedicated to its
                    service, may for a long time have been sick within itself and bent upon its own
                    destruction. </p>

                  <p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">ROFESSOR</hi> Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was just
                    back from a visit to America. One afternoon, soon after his return, he put on
                    his <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r177" target="en177">frock-coat</ref> and drove in a hansom to pay a call upon Hilda Burgoyne, who
                    still lived at her old number, off Bedford Square. He and Miss Burgoyne had been
                    fast friends for a long time. He had first noticed her about the corridors of
                    the British Museum, where he read constantly. Her being there so often had made
                    him feel that he would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible
                    person, an introduction was not difficult. The preliminaries once over, they
                    came to depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day's
                    reading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea. They had much more in
                    common than their memories of a common friend. Indeed, they seldom spoke of him.
                    They saved that for the deep moments which do not come often, and then their
                    talk of him was mostly silence. Wilson knew that Hilda had loved him; more than
                    this he had not tried to know. </p>
                  <p>It was late when Wilson reached Hilda's apartment on this particular December afternoon, and he found her alone. She sent for
                    fresh tea and made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people
                    comfortable. </p>
                  <p>"How good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays
                    without you. You've helped me over a good many Christmases." She smiled at him
                    gayly. </p>
                  <p>"As if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. How well
                    you are looking, my dear, and how rested." </p>
                  <p>He peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long fingers
                    together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with years. </p>
                  <p>Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. "That means that I was looking
                    very seedy at the end of the season, does n't it? Well, we must show wear at
                    last, you know." </p>
                  <p>Wilson took the cup gratefully. "Ah, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has
                    just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries. I was most
                    gently treated&#8212;as a sort of precious relic. But, do you know, it made
                    me feel awkward to be hanging about still." </p>
                  <p>"Seventy? Never mention it to me." Hilda looked appreciatively at the Professor's alert face, with so many kindly lines about
                    the mouth and so many quizzical ones about the eyes. "You've got to hang about
                    for me, you know. I can't even let you go home again. You must stay put, now
                    that I have you back. You're the realest thing I have." </p>
                  <p>Wilson chuckled. "Dear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the spoils of
                    conquered cities! You've really missed me? Well, then, I shall hang. Even if you
                    have at last to put <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the mummy-room with the others. You'll visit me
                    often, won't you?" </p>
                  <p>"Every day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer, where you
                    left them." She struck a match and lit one for him. "But you did, after all,
                    enjoy being at home again?" </p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a thousand miles
                    apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the place. It was in Boston I
                    lingered longest." </p>
                  <p>"Ah, you saw Mrs. Alexander?" </p>
                  <p>"Often. I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I should
                    think. Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on. I found that I still
                    loved to go to the house. It always seemed as if Bartley were there, somehow,
                    and that at any moment one might hear his heavy tramp on the stairs. Do you know, I kept feeling that he must be up in his
                    study." The Professor looked reflectively into the grate. "I should
                    really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last long talk with
                    him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it." </p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>Wilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so quickly that
                    his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and pulled them awry. "Why?
                    Why, dear me, I don't know. She probably never thought of it." </p>
                  <p>Hilda bit her lip. "I don't know what made me say that. I did n't mean to
                    interrupt. Go on, please, and tell me how it was." </p>
                  <p>"Well, it was like that. Almost as if he were there. In a way, he really is
                    there. She never lets him go. It's the most beautiful and dignified sorrow I've
                    ever known. It's so beautiful that it has its compensations, I should think. Its
                    very completeness is a compensation. It <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r178" target="en178">gives her a fixed star to steer by</ref>. She
                    does n't drift. We sat there evening after evening in the quiet of that
                    magically haunted room, and watched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him.
                    Felt him with a difference, of course." </p>
                  <p>Hilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand. "With a
                    difference? Because of her, you mean?" </p>
                  <p>Wilson's brow wrinkled. "Something like that, yes. Of course, as time goes on, to
                    her he becomes more and more their simple personal relation." </p>
                  <p>Hilda studied the droop of the Professor's head intently. "You did n't altogether
                    like that? You felt it was n't wholly fair to him?" </p>
                  <p>Wilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses. "Oh, fair enough. More than
                    fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a little different
                    from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold absolutely all of a
                    person. And I liked him just as he was; his deviations, too; the places where he
                    did n't square." </p>
                  <p>Hilda considered vaguely. "Has she grown much older?" she asked at last. </p>
                  <p>"Yes, and no. In a tragic way she is even handsomer. But colder. Cold for
                    everything but him. <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r179" target="en179">'Forget thyself to marble'</ref>; I kept thinking of that. Her
                    happiness was a <ref type="editorial" xml:id="r180" target="en180">happiness <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">&#224; deux</foreign>
                     </ref>, not apart from the world,
                    but actually against it. And now her grief is like that. She saves herself for
                    it and does n't even go through the form of seeing people much. I'm sorry. It
                    would be better for her, and might be so good for them, if she could let other
                    people in." </p>
                  <p>"Perhaps she's afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with somebody." Wilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm. "Dear me, it takes a
                    woman to think of that, now! I don't, you know, think we ought to be hard on
                    her. More, even, than the rest of us she did n't choose her destiny. She
                    underwent it. And it has left her chilled. As to her not wishing to take the
                    world into her confidence&#8212;well, it is a pretty brutal and stupid
                    world, after all, you know." </p>
                  <p>Hilda leaned forward. "Yes, I know, I know. Only I can't help being glad that
                    there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people. My little Marie
                    worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when she has come to his
                    picture." </p>
                  <p>Wilson nodded. "Oh, yes! He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He
                    belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at
                    the best. We should n't wonder too much at Mrs. Alexander. She must feel how
                    useless it would be to stir about, that she may as well sit still; that nothing
                    can happen to her after Bartley." </p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Hilda softly, "nothing can happen to one after Bartley." </p>
                  <p>They both sat looking into the fire. </p>

                    through those materials. </p>
            <p>Consultations with several people were especially helpful in the early stages of
                    the preparation of the Cather Edition. In <hi rend="italic">Willa Cather: A Bibliography
                   </hi> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1982), Joan Crane provided an
                    authoritative starting place for our identification and assembly of basic
                    materials, then in correspondence was unfailingly generous with her expertise.
                    The late Fredson Bowers (University of Virginia) advised us about the steps
                    necessary to organize the project. David J. Nordloh (Indiana University)
                    provided advice as we established policies and procedures and wrote our editorial manual. As editor of the Lewis and Clark journals, Gary
                    Moulton (University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln) generously provided
                    expertise and encouragement. Conversations with Richard Rust (University of
                    North Carolina&#8211;Chapel Hill) were helpful in refining procedures
                    concerning variants. </p>

                  <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> conventional picture of the first novel by Willa Cather, <hi rend="italic">Alexander's
                        Bridge</hi> (1912), is that it was a misstep in her career, that she was too
                    infatuated with the examples of Henry James and Edith Wharton and had to outgrow
                    a literary manner that ill-suited her before she embraced her most vital
                    material, life on the Nebraska Divide. Cather came into her own, she herself
                    said, when she "hit the home pasture" in her second novel, <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!
                    </hi> (1913).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her1" target="hen1"/> However, this view of the book is guided
                    by the author's own published statements about her motives and her assessments
                    of her creative origins. Because Cather made those three statements over a
                    period of nearly twenty years, it is perhaps prudent to inspect them more
                    closely, for in the absence of manuscripts, galleys, corrected proof sheets, or
                    other forms of prepublication evidence, and with scant reference to
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> in her letters, we are inevitably drawn to
                    Cather's published accounts of her first novel. </p>
                  <p>All three accounts raise as many questions as they answer. The first occurs in a
                    brief interview in the <hi rend="italic">New York Sun</hi>, 25 May 1912, "Literary News, Views,
                    and Criticism" (see Bohlke 6). There, Cather attempts to correct certain misapprehensions of her
                    purposes: <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> is not an "industrial novel"; it is not a
                    story about bridge building, but about a man who happened to build bridges. Nor
                    is the title character patterned after an identifiable person. Instead, Bartley
                    Alexander "simply has some of the characteristics which I have noticed in a
                    dozen architects, engineers and inventors." And the interviewer's suspicion
                    notwithstanding, Hilda Burgoyne does not resemble the actress Hilda
                    Trevelyan.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her2" target="hen2"/> On the contrary, Cather says, she tried "to
                    give the actress in this story certain qualities which I have found oftener in
                    English actresses than in our own." The psychological dimension of the novel is
                    likewise characterized in straightforward fashion: Alexander is a "pagan, a
                    crude force, with little respect for anything but youth and work and power." He
                    marries a woman of greater sophistication and with "more clearly defined
                    standards," standards he can admire but only imperfectly comprehend. So long as
                    he is fully engaged in his work, she continues, Alexander functions well, but
                    "he runs the risk of encountering new emotional as well as new intellectual
                    stimuli" (Bohlke 6). </p>
                  <p>In the light of Cather's subsequent comments, this account is interesting for
                    several reasons. First, the novel's theme appears to be in keeping with the
                    implied thematic coherence of her collection of short fiction titled <hi rend="italic">The
                        Troll Garden</hi> (1905), expressed by epigrams Cather chose from Christina
                    Rossetti and Charles Kingsley.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her3" target="hen3"/> As Bernice Slote observes,
                    Alexander is something of a vigorous "forest child" inside a corrupting garden, who is in danger of the sort of dissipation and
                    corruption that she had identified through the Kingsley epigram
                    (xxv&#8211;xxvi). Second, nothing in Cather's statement indicates the
                    influence of James or Wharton; instead, her commentary suggests a
                    naturalistic approach to her subject.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her4" target="hen4"/> The forces that
                    motivate her title character seem to be biological in nature and invite
                    comparisons with Frank Norris's <hi rend="italic">McTeague</hi>, a novel she admiringly reviewed
                    in 1899.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her5" target="hen5"/> As a social type, Alexander is in keeping with a
                    figure Elizabeth Ammons has identified&#8212;the engineer as cultural hero.
                    Instead of following the example of Richard Harding Davis or Harold Bell Wright,
                    Ammons suggests, Cather may have been calling this fictional archetype into deep
                    question.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her6" target="hen6"/> Finally, Cather, contrary to her later
                    commentary, presents herself not as an inexperienced novelist or even a
                    first-time novelist but as someone who knew what she was doing and why. </p>
                  <p>Over the next two decades, Cather gave two other accounts of the creation of
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>. The first served as a preface to a reissue of the
                    novel in 1922, the second as the essay "My First Novels (There Were Two),"
                    published in <hi rend="italic">The Colophon</hi> in 1931. In both instances, Cather looks back
                    on the novel with a degree of skepticism. These essays substantially differ from
                    the remarks in the earlier interview and somewhat from one another. </p>
                  <p>In the preface, Cather characterizes her writing of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> as
                    a youthful mistake and herself as an "inexperienced writer": "Everything is new
                    to the young writer, and everything seems equally personal" (195). She had not yet come to appreciate
                    the familiar, the life she had lived as opposed to the life she sought out or
                    observed. But the "people and the places of the story interested me intensely at
                    the time when it was written, because they were new to me and were in themselves
                    attractive" (195). <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> was essentially an "external" story
                    written out of the stimulus of the "glitter of the passing show" (196). (Her use
                    of this phrase is interesting because "The Passing Show" was the title of one of
                    the weekly columns she wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Nebraska State Journal</hi> and, later,
                    for the <hi rend="italic">Lincoln Courier</hi>.) Furthermore, she announces that her literary
                    manner was somewhat imitative. The young writer must necessarily "have his
                    affair with the external material he covets" and "strive to follow the masters
                    he most admires, until he finds he is starving for reality and cannot make this
                    go any longer" (197). In contrast, <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi> drew upon her natural
                    material, and, borrowing from the language of Henri Bergson, she adds that it
                    was written "with the wisdom of intuition as opposed to that of intellect"
                    (197). </p>
                  <p>Of course, in 1912 Cather was not really an inexperienced writer. She was
                    thirty-seven years old; her first essay had been published in 1891, her first
                    short story the following year. By 1912 she had published a volume of poetry,
                        <hi rend="italic">April Twilights</hi> (1903), more than forty short stories, and <hi rend="italic">The
                        Troll Garden</hi>. As early as 1905 she had completed a first novel, about
                    which we know little except that it had been rejected by S. S. McClure and that
                    Cather thought it not good enough to rework but too good to throw away (Woodress 182). Cather's
                    characterization of herself probably has less to do with experience, or lack of
                    it, than with a sense of having since come into her artistic maturity. </p>
                  <p>Similarly, most if not all of the interesting "people and places" that entered
                    into the making of her novel were not necessarily "new" to Cather. As we shall
                    see, most of those scenes derived from earlier visits to Europe: her first to
                    England and the Continent with Isabelle McClung in 1902, a second to Italy in
                    1908, and another to London and Paris in 1909. Cather never completely outgrew
                    the stimulation she received from her first visit to Europe. As her longtime
                    companion Edith Lewis notes, Cather's visit to Avignon on that first trip left a
                    lasting impression: "She always wanted to write a story about Avignon; it was
                    the subject of her last, unfinished story". </p>
                  <p>Passages in "My First Novels" provide yet another self-portrait of Cather as an
                    artist. This essay is principally concerned with <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi>, a book
                    Cather reimagines as her first novel because its creation was "spontaneous" (92)
                    and natural to her, and was a "novel of the soil" before that sort of story had
                    become fashionable (93). <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, by contrast, followed the
                    "most conventional pattern": it was more or less set in London; it dealt with
                    "interesting material," but only superficially and in the manner that painters
                    call a "studio picture" (91); there was a great deal of "arranging" and
                    "inventing" in it, because she had adopted the "conventional editorial point of
                    view" (92); it was also conventional because it had a "hero" and "action" and "clever people" saying clever
                    things. Finally, she suggests that, like most young writers at the time, she
                    followed the literary manner of James and Wharton, "without having their
                    qualifications" (93). </p>
                  <p>Cather added that shortly after finishing <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> she traveled
                    to the desert Southwest, "a country I really did care about, and among people
                    who were part of the country." The longer she stayed there, the more obvious it
                    became to her how "unnecessary and superficial" <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> really
                    was (92). If this is so, there is no hint of that attitude in her interview for
                    the <hi rend="italic">New York Sun</hi>, given after she returned from Arizona.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her7" target="hen7"/> Perhaps more interesting is the suggestion that her natural material was
                    no longer confined to Nebraska; it now extended to New Mexico and Arizona. </p>
                  <p>The differences among these statements can be attributed to nothing more
                    significant than Cather's presentation of a revised but attractive artistic
                    identity, something any shrewd professional writer is apt to do. The later
                    essays were instances of recollection through the lens of time, and her
                    assessments of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> were surely affected by her subsequent
                    achievements and artistic growth. They usefully describe a writer finding her
                    way at a critical point, and these very differences provoke questions about the
                    novel itself. </p>
                  <p>Is <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> a "studio picture" filled with clever conversation?
                    There is something of that, but the novel is by no means saturated with
                    sophisticated banter. Much of the European setting is outdoors, not in the
                    drawing room. More often we are given solitary walks or intimate carriage rides or Alexander
                    and Hilda together in her apartment. Through dramatic presentation and
                    recollection of Alexander's student days, Cather imagines the spectacle that is
                    London or Paris, the city sights and revered public institutions, in preference
                    to witty social scenes. </p>
                  <p>Does the novel actually reveal the fundamental influences of James and
                    Wharton?<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her8" target="hen8"/> While Cather may move her representative
                    American character back and forth across the Atlantic, her novel is not
                    "international" in the Jamesian sense. It does not render the Old World with the
                    confidence derived from long acquaintance, nor does it inspect closely the
                    cultural differences among several characters. Alexander is an American in
                    London, where many admire him for his raw-boned energy and efficiency. But from
                    the first, Professor Lucius Wilson directs the reader's attention to the true
                    interest of Cather's title character: he is the "most tremendous response to
                    stimuli I have ever known" (9); he is a "powerfully equipped nature" and has the
                    "fascination of a scientific discovery" (17). </p>
                  <p>Cather had joined the staff of <hi rend="italic">McClure's Magazine</hi> in 1906, after working
                    as a journalist and as a teacher. Her first important editorial assignment had
                    been to rework Georgine Milmine's manuscript, <hi rend="italic">Mary Baker G. Eddy: Her Life
                        and the History of Christian Science</hi>, which ran in fourteen installments
                    in <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> from 1907 until 1909. The job had required her to spend much
                    time in Boston, verifying Milmine's information, as well as rewriting the
                    manuscript. This experience gave her the background for the Boston setting of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> as
                    well as many new and stimulating acquaintances, such as Annie Fields and the
                    writer Sarah Orne Jewett. </p>
                  <p>S. S. McClure liked Cather's work, but Cather found the job tedious and tiring.
                    However, one consequence of her efforts was her appointment as managing editor
                    of the magazine. McClure did not seem much interested in Cather's own artistic
                    ambitions. Cather wrote to Jewett complaining that McClure wanted her to divide
                    her time between writing in the manner of Ida Tarbell (on popular science and
                    social issues) and running the office. Mr. McClure, she added somewhat bitterly,
                    did not think much of her prospects as a writer; he believed she was better
                    suited for the executive duties that continually left her tired and feeling she
                    was missing out on life's more stimulating aspects (19 December 1908). Meantime,
                    she was harried by illness, occupied with travel, and committed to a magazine
                    that, though it had half a million readers, was in financial difficulty.
                    Nevertheless, Cather was deeply involved in the literary culture, both in New
                    York and, when editorial duties took her there, in London. </p>
                  <p>Cather had traveled to London in 1909, while still recuperating from an
                    operation, and apparently anticipated a trip there in April 1911 and another in
                    the spring of 1912: on 17 November 1911 she wrote to S. S. McClure saying that
                    she would not go abroad if business at the magazine required her to stay in New
                    York.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her9" target="hen9"/> Cather herself seems as anxious as Alexander
                    often is to get back to London, though for different reasons. For Cather this desire was a cultural and geographical matter,
                    whereas Alexander wants to be in London because Hilda and his lost youth seem to
                    be there. Cather moves her title character back and forth across the Atlantic
                    with such frequency that we might wonder whether his emotional dilemma and his
                    eagerness to get back to London are plot devices designed to bring two realms of
                    experience into conjunction. Although Alexander attends meetings, presumably to
                    consult with British engineers about the Moorlock Bridge he is constructing in
                    Quebec, engineering practices and building codes for bridge construction in
                    Quebec were actually entirely a Canadian matter; they would not have required
                    the designer to visit England. </p>
                  <p>Cather's projected trip to London in April 1911 apparently was canceled (Woodress
                    211). However, Cather did travel to Boston for a few weeks in May and early
                    June, in part to see Mrs. Annie Fields. Later in June she was in Maine, where
                    she visited Mary Jewett, the sister of Sarah Orne Jewett, who had died two years
                    earlier. By the end of June she was back at her desk in New York. According to
                    Edith Lewis, Cather composed <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> during these few months
                    (May through September) (76). Apparently, the novel had been accepted for
                    publication in <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> before she left with her friend Isabelle McClung
                    for Cherry Valley, New York, near Schenectady, on September.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her10" target="hen10"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Cherry Valley, Cather may have revised her text for serial publication in
                        <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi>; the novel, under the title <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Masquerade</hi>,
                    would appear in three installments in 1912.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her11" target="hen11"/> Presumably, Cather kept at least one other
                    copy of her typescript in order to submit it, or a revision of it, to editor
                    Ferris Greenslet of Houghton Mifflin, in Boston. Houghton
                    Mifflin records show that the manuscript was received on 21 November
                    1911 and that Greenslet recommended acceptance to the publishers the next day.
                    His report characterized this work (as he said some reviewers had characterized
                        <hi rend="italic">The Troll Garden</hi>) as comparable to Wharton's fiction. He emphasized
                    this point once more at the end of the report. </p>
                  <p>Greenslet summarized the plot of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> briefly but
                    pointed out that it is the book's "least important part"; rather, the novel is
                    distinguished by the "excellence of the workmanship, its remarkable
                    perceptiveness, its actuality, and the spiritual sense of life that informs it."
                    These are vague but strongly supportive statements. Greenslet was probably alert
                    to the sensitivities of the publisher, for he noted that the illicit affair was
                    "quite unobjectionably handled." By identifying a "spiritual sense of life" in
                    the book he may have been anticipating some reluctance to accept the manuscript.
                    He also observed that <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> was scheduled to publish the novel and
                    that S. S. McClure was to write the advertising, so the book would be publicized
                    at no cost to them. Greenslet added that, should it prove desirable, they could
                    no doubt obtain the illustrations used in the magazine at a reasonable cost. </p>
                  <p>This ardent sponsorship of the book would be necessary, since Greenslet was
                    essentially arguing that Houghton Mifflin take the book not for immediate profit (he estimated the novel might sell at
                    best four thousand copies) but because Cather was a "promising" writer and "in
                    every way a desirable connection for us." Greenslet was right, of course;
                    Houghton Mifflin did eventually profit by the connection. In any case,
                    the book was accepted for publication on 22 November 1911. Cather might have
                    made further revisions between that time and when she signed the contract on 1
                    December (see the Textual Essay), but she would have had very little time
                    afterward, for the records indicate that the manuscript was ready for the
                    printer by 6 December. </p>

                  <head type="main" rend="center-italic">The Influence of Place</head>
                  <p>The sources for and influences upon <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> are of several sorts: Cather's personal
                    experiences, especially travels to London and the Continent, which brought her
                    in contact with fascinating people and places; literary influences,
                    including specific texts that might have served as models for her novel, as well
                    as the literary techniques of those artists she had read and admired; and
                    newsworthy events of national interest that played an instrumental role in the
                    development of plot and character, the most notable of which was the collapse of
                    the Quebec Bridge on 29 August 1907. All of these sources and
                    influences can be clarified through reference to the historical or
                    social context of the time, and Cather's intentions can be discerned through
                    certain patterns of allusions. </p>
                  <p>Of all these possible influences on the composition of the novel, Cather publicly acknowledged only the first&#8212;that is, the people
                    and places that so excited her when she traveled to London. The impressions her
                    travels provided her, she confessed in "My First Novels," were ones she "tried
                    to communicate on paper"; they were "genuine," she added, "but they were very
                    shallow" (91). On her trip to London in 1909, largely through her association
                    with <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> and her acquaintances with the drama critic and writer
                    William Archer and the English publisher William Heinemann, she moved
                    comfortably in established literary circles. Cather met Ford Madox Ford, H. G.
                    Wells, John Galsworthy, and others. She sat in William Butler Yeats's box, along
                    with Lady Gregory, to see Maire O'Neill in the London debut of John Millington
                    Synge's notorious <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi> (7 June 1909). No doubt
                    her admittance to this social arena was both pleasing and somewhat dazzling, but
                    apparently none of the luminaries she met served as prototypes for any
                    characters in <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>. Some of her creations&#8212;Maurice
                    Mainhall, for example&#8212;are probably composite pictures that borrowed
                    features or mannerisms from her English acquaintances. Only one person provided
                    her with a model for an important character in the book, and there is no
                    evidence that Cather actually met her. That person was Maire O'Neill, who played
                    Pegeen Mike in <hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi>, and about whom we will have more to say. </p>
                  <p>Places impressed Cather: <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> may be an external novel in
                    the sense that she imported recollections of different scenes and places into
                    the book and made them serve her artistic purposes. Many of those places appear to have only an
                    incidental relation to the plot. Cather might identify with her created
                    character, because she and Alexander shared a feeling that one's
                    "potentialities" were not being lived out (13); this feeling is clear from her
                    letter to Jewett and elsewhere. Like Alexander, Cather was keenly responsive to
                    certain stimuli. However, those stimuli were qualitatively
                    different&#8212;Alexander responds to people and events seen through the
                    lens of lost youth, while Cather, by her own admission, felt exhilarated by a
                    new social environment and the dazzle of the passing show. </p>
                  <p>Cather drew upon memories of scenes that had for her the vivid brilliance of
                    newness. In much the same way that she combined in "Paul's Case" the
                    recollection of a high school boy she had known in Pittsburgh with her own
                    excited reaction to New York City, she gave to Alexander emotions she had
                    herself experienced.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her12" target="hen12"/> However, for Alexander,
                    Cather located the origins of those feelings not in stimulating and interesting
                    people and places but in his desperate sense of lost youth and ardor. In this
                    sense, <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> could have easily worn the same subtitle she
                    gave to "Paul's Case," for it too is a "study in temperament"; but, as with the
                    short story, the author's temperament, which gives an emotional color to the
                    narrative, ought not be confused with Alexander's psychological condition. </p>
                  <p>Some parts of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> seem to have less to do with scene
                    setting than with sightseeing. So far as the formal coherence of the novel or
                    Alexander's emotional turmoil and indecision are concerned, the dialogue and events of these episodes could have
                    happened anywhere. For Cather, however, these places were probably tinged with
                    powerful emotional resonances. We can establish a catalog of the scenes that
                    appear to derive principally from Cather's experience. </p>
                  <p>In chapter 1, Lucius Wilson's walk to the Alexander house on Brimmer Street
                    retraces familiar territory, for Cather lived on nearby Chestnut Street when
                    working on the Milmine manuscript. During her stay there she met, among others,
                    Mrs. James T. (Annie) Fields and Sarah Orne Jewett, and the neighborhood had
                    associations with a rich literary and intellectual environment. She describes
                    some of those feelings in her essay "148 Charles St."<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her13" target="hen13"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nearly all of chapter 2 focuses on the Duke of York's Theatre, where Hilda
                    Burgoyne plays Peggy, a donkey girl, in the obviously Irish though fictional
                    play <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights</hi>. Like Alexander, Cather was the beneficiary of her
                    acquaintances and sat in Yeats's box at the opening of Synge's <hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi> at
                    the Royal Court Theatre, where she saw Maire O'Neill. In the company of drama
                    critic William Archer she saw Lady Gregory's <hi rend="italic">The Rising of the Moon</hi>, a
                    one-act play that concludes with a fugitive singing the popular ballad of that
                    name.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her14" target="hen14"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In chapter 3, Alexander walks from his hotel to locate Hilda's lodgings off
                    Bedford Square; a few days later he walks along the Victoria Embankment, crosses
                    the Thames on the Westminster Bridge, and watches the Houses of Parliament aglow
                    with the color of sunset. In her 10 August 1902 travel letter for the
                        <hi rend="italic">Nebraska State Journal</hi>, Cather notes that she had found a comfortable hotel "almost under the dome" of St. Paul's Cathedral. "We
                    came here," she wrote, "because we wanted to be within walking distance of the
                    Tower, Old Bailey, and the Temple." She and Isabelle McClung typically began
                    their walking tour of the city in the morning but would soon become diverted:
                    one starts "to make pilgrimages in the orthodox fashion, but one ends by merely
                    watching the procession with perplexity" (<hi rend="italic">World and the Parish</hi> 2: 907). </p>
                  <p>In chapter 4, Hilda and Alexander recall their student days in Paris, including a
                    particular walk to the Place Saint-Michel, and along the Rue Saint-Jacques. And
                    there are vivid images of light, the scent of lilacs, and the tragic face of an
                    old woman. Again, to the degree that it was not entirely invented, this
                    recollection may have come from the 1902 trip; curiously, Cather did not write
                    much about Paris for the <hi rend="italic">Nebraska State Journal</hi>, restricting herself to a
                    travel letter about "Two Cemeteries in Paris" (<hi rend="italic">World and the Parish</hi> 2:
                    924&#8211;29). </p>
                  <p>In chapter 5, Cather renders with great detail Alexander's steamship trip to
                    London&#8212;the high swells of an oily sea, the smell of damp woolens, the
                    humidity that made his hair collect drops of moisture, and so forth. She divides
                    her attention between descriptive passages of the voyage and an assessment of
                    Alexander's vacillating and troubled state of mind. This scene could have been
                    based on one of her trips abroad or a composite picture of different crossings. </p>
                  <p>Chapter 7 is given over almost entirely to Alexander and Hilda's carriage ride to
                    Kew and Richmond and back into London. This is one of the most extensive travel-like scenes in the novel, and
                    the reader's attention is divided between the lovers' conversation and a tour
                    through London on a rare day of fine weather. Cather's description of London
                    light here, as William Curtin observes in a footnote (<hi rend="italic">World and the
                        Parish</hi> 2: 912n), is reminiscent of a similar description in the travel
                    letter "Kensington Studio." Cather remarked on the changing quality of light as
                    one travels westward from the city along Piccadilly toward Kensington: "From
                    Trafalgar westward the very color of the city changes; the grimy blackness of
                    the smokeladen town grows to a splendid grey about the National Gallery and St.
                    Martin-in-the-Fields, and from there the color runs gradually into a higher and
                    higher key, into the glorious green of the parks and the bold white of the club
                    houses along Piccadilly, and finally into the broad asphalts of Kensington that
                    are covered, or rather dusted, with a yellow sand that catches the sunlight like
                    gold powder" (<hi rend="italic">World and the Parish</hi> 2: 912).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her15" target="hen15"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cather might have combined her own recollections with images evoked by a poem by
                    Alfred Noyes. Toward the end of their carriage ride, Alexander observes: "How
                    many street pianos there are about to-night! The fine weather must have thawed
                    them out. We've had five miles of 'Il Trovatore' now. They always make me feel
                    jaunty" (87). The reference to <hi rend="italic">Il Trovatore</hi> may have less to do with
                    Verdi's opera by that name than it does with Noyes's popular poem "The Barrel
                    Organ" (1904; see the Explanatory Notes). The weather, the time of year, the
                    sunset light, the bustle and tramp of the crowd, and of course the music of street pianos have their analogues in Noyes's poem.
                    Perhaps more important is the fact that London is characterized as the land of
                    lost love where "dead dreams go." A London laborer, for example, "stares into
                    the sunset where his April love is fled, / For he hears her softly
                    singing and his lonely soul is led / Through the land where the dead dreams go"
                    (Noyes 230). Not only does Alexander ask Hilda to sing for him in chapter 4, but
                    his search, through her love, for his own dream of youth and expectancy is
                    mirrored in this and other passages in the poem. </p>
                  <p>Other episodes might also have drawn upon Cather's recollections. In chapter 8,
                    for example, Hugh MacConnell walks Hilda home from the theater on a foggy night.
                    And Alexander's train trip to Quebec might have been informed by Cather's own
                    recent (1911) journey to Portland, Maine; she would not have had to go to Canada
                    to see "gray rocks and hills and meadows" (105), smell the "pine-scented air"
                    (109), or view the crystal-clear sky, at any rate. This journey is principally
                    devoted to dramatizing Alexander's unquiet mind and sense of personal
                    indecision, but Alexander does imagine yet another trip to London (145). While
                    glancing out the window to see a group of boys camped along a marsh, he recalls
                    camping "on a sandbar in a Western river" during his youth (105&#8211;06).
                    As has often been pointed out, this seems to be a reference both to Cather's
                    story "The Enchanted Bluff " (1909) and to her own childhood in Nebraska (see
                    Explanatory Notes). </p>
                  <p>The reasons for this summary of episodes that probably derived from Cather's experience are several. First, as already suggested, the
                    author might have imported her own feelings and impressions of people and places
                    into her narrative quite easily. Second, this early in her career, it was an
                    article of faith with Cather that such sharp feelings were necessary for good
                    writing. In a letter to her former student Norman Foerster (10 July 1910), she
                    advised that excellent writing comes from close and engaged acquaintance with
                    the things of this world, for that is what gives it an individual character. And
                    in a letter written in Naples to her former teacher Alice E. D. Goudy (3 May 1908), she says that one ought to read the densely detailed
                    histories of Tacitus and Seutonius in Italy because the details must have a
                    physical reality and tangible character. However, those same impressions of her
                    trips to London, Cather later came to believe, were thin and shallow, or as she
                    put it in her preface, "youthful vanities and gaudy extravagances" (196). Third,
                    one of the reasons why she might have come to deprecate her first novel has to
                    do with the imported character of those impressions. The scenes and episodes
                    instanced above are for the most part attached to the consciousness of Bartley
                    Alexander, but he is too self-absorbed, on the one hand, and too jaded, on the
                    other, to be an adequate register of the sorts of emotions Cather had
                    experienced. </p>
                  <p>Episodes deriving from Cather's travels and the feelings associated with them
                    constitute nearly a quarter of the book. Cather's own comments in "My First
                    Novels" notwithstanding, a great deal of this novel is not set in the "drawing room," nor does it deal with "smart and clever" people. Alexander and Hilda
                    derive their most vital and engaging qualities from their rural backgrounds, and
                    these same qualities are dramatized most effectively in scenes that
                    reflect Cather's vivid and deeply felt memories in combination with
                    their own passions and desires. </p>

                  <head type="main" rend="center-italic">The Influence of Events and People</head>
                  <p>Two principal events influenced the genesis of Cather's novel. The first was the collapse
                    of the Quebec Bridge on 29 August 1907. Ever since John P. Hinz's 1950 essay
                    "The Real Alexander's Bridge," critics have acknowledged that the collapse of
                    Moorlock Bridge was based on an actual bridge disaster and that, at least in
                    certain details, elements of the plot and the behavior of Bartley Alexander were
                    patterned after the consulting engineer, Theodore Cooper. The second event was
                    the emergence of the Irish National Theatre, which promoted a nationalistic
                    aesthetic ideology and achieved a certain notoriety with the production of
                    Synge's <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi>, in which the prototype for Hilda
                    Burgoyne appeared in the role of Pegeen Mike. Critics have largely ignored the
                    importance of this influence. The relation of these events to specific
                    passages in or aspects of the novel are dealt with in some detail in the
                    Explanatory Notes. Here we will describe these influences as they bear
                    upon the genesis of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>. </p>
                  <p>The construction of the Quebec Bridge was newsworthy even before its collapse;
                    the bridge was an emblem for the progressive era of scientific efficiency. If only symbolically, the catastrophe
                    left progressive prospects in doubt; nearly eighty workers died, and the event
                    triggered an exhaustive Canadian inquiry into the disaster. In 1906, in an
                    article titled "Erection of the Quebec Bridge," <hi rend="italic">Scientific American</hi> had
                    hailed the project as a prospective engineering triumph, and <hi rend="italic">Canadian
                    Magazine</hi> ran a lengthy article by James Johnstone on the history of
                    "Bridging the St. Lawrence." The undertaking was a matter of national pride for
                    Canadians and Americans alike, for it was to be the longest cantilever bridge in
                    the world and it was, for all intents and purposes, an American feat of
                    engineering. The designers were Americans; the steel members for the bridge were
                    manufactured by the Phoenixville Bridge Company of Pennsylvania; many of the
                    welders, mechanics, and riveters were Americans. </p>
                  <p>Once complete, the Quebec Bridge would have been an eighteen-hundred-foot steel
                    construction spanning the St. Lawrence River, exceeding in length by some ninety
                    feet the then-longest cantilever, the Forth Bridge in Scotland. The original
                    design for the bridge called for a span of sixteen hundred feet, but Theodore
                    Cooper, the consulting engineer, recommended changing the design after the
                    contract for construction had been drawn up. Thus, cost projections were
                    modified; resulting design changes led to strain on the lower compression
                    members and the bridge's collapse. </p>
                  <p>Newspaper coverage was extensive and sensational, rivaling the subsequent
                    coverage of the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> in April 1912. The journalistic
                    importance of the event is suggested by two front-page headlines printed side by side in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times
                    </hi> on 30 August 1907: <hi rend="smallcaps">MARS INHABITED, SAYS PROF. LOWELL"</hi>
                     <ref type="editorial" xml:id="her16" target="hen16"/> and, in larger bold type, <hi rend="smallcaps">"BRIDGE
                    FALLS DROWNING 80</hi>." For the journalist, the Quebec Bridge collapse had all the
                    ingredients of a newsworthy story &#8212;considerable loss of life, tragic
                    technological miscalculation, the drama of an urgent telegram to cease work
                    having been fatally delayed, and the fall from public esteem of a celebrated
                    engineer. </p>
                  <p>Given the widespread publicity about the event, it is curious that only one
                    reviewer of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> even mentions, and then only in passing,
                    the Quebec Bridge calamity as a source. Surely contemporary readers could not
                    have failed to notice the similarities, but perhaps the connection was so
                    obvious that it did not require explanation. The parallels are so explicit that
                    it seems clear Cather was not attempting to disguise the connection. However,
                    there is no evidence that she was trying to exploit the notoriety of the
                    subject,<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her17" target="hen17"/>and she insisted that hers was not an
                    "industrial novel" of the muckraking sort. Although her story followed
                    accurately the events leading up to the bridge collapse, the divergences from
                    fact are the more interesting because they show that Cather adapted the
                    historical event to her own artistic purposes. </p>
                  <p>Moorlock, like its prototype, was to be the longest cantilever bridge in the
                    world. The cause of the collapse is also identical&#8212;too much stress on
                    a lower compression member. The Moorlock Bridge, like the Quebec Bridge, "sank
                    almost in a vertical line, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went" (114; see
                    illustrations 18&#8211;21, esp. 21). Cather reduced the number of casualties
                    only slightly. She writes that "by morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out
                    of the river, but there were still twenty missing" (115); the <hi rend="italic">New York Times
                   </hi> (30 August 1907) initially reported that eighty men had died, but that
                    estimate was later lowered to seventy-five. </p>
                  <p>Cather changed the facts in some important ways. Although he was not the bridge's
                    principal designer, Theodore Cooper, the consulting engineer, was the focus of
                    most newspaper and magazine pieces about the disaster. In appearance and manner
                    he was nothing like Bartley Alexander. He was sixty-eight years old at the time
                    of the collapse; he had not been on the site of construction for more than two
                    years prior to the accident; he was somewhat vain and arrogant; and, by his own
                    admission, he was a frail and unhealthy man.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her18" target="hen18"/>Alexander, by contrast, looks "as a tamer of rivers ought to
                    look"&#8212;forty-three years old, over six feet tall, and "glowing with
                    strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks" (10). He complains that he
                    is being forced by the bridge commission to "build pretty well to the strain
                    limit up there. They've crowded me too much on the cost" (62). Cooper, on the
                    other hand, was at least complicitous in cost-cutting measures, and in fact
                    boasted that the Quebec Bridge would be the "best and cheapest," a future model
                    of bridge construction.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her19" target="hen19"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fatal moment in Cather's plot involves the nondelivery of a telegram sent to
                    Alexander apprising him of worries about the bridge and asking him to come at once. The first telegram does not
                    reach him because he is with Hilda in his New York apartment and unavailable to
                    receive it; a second reaches him the next day, too late to avert the
                    catastrophe. In actuality, Cooper had been advised by Norman McLure (the man he
                    had appointed to keep him informed about the construction project), first by
                    telegram and then in person, that the lower chords of the bridge were shifting.
                    After meeting with McLure on 29 August, Cooper sent a wire to the chief engineer
                    advising them not to add more weight to the bridge until the condition of the
                    compression members could be properly evaluated. Delivery of that telegram was
                    delayed, perhaps obstructed, by a telegraph strike. Cooper at first said he
                    ordered that work on the bridge be stopped immediately; later he modified those
                    remarks, saying that, as consulting engineer, he lacked the authority to stop
                    construction. In any event, apparently he made no plans to visit the site even
                    after the danger became clear. </p>
                  <p>There are other changes to the facts. First, Cather says Alexander was the "Chief
                    Engineer" (116) for the Moorlock Bridge project, but he was the designer, not an
                    engineer. The chief engineer would be required to work on the construction site.
                    Neither the designer of the Quebec Bridge, Paul Szlapka, nor the consulting
                    engineer, Theodore Cooper, worked on-site.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her20" target="hen20"/>Second,
                    for dramatic purposes, Cather was likely drawn to the notion of the intertwined
                    fates of the creator and the creation, but she altered facts in having her
                    bridge builder die in the St. Lawrence River. Third, Alexander often complains about the pressures from the "commission" to build the
                    bridge cheaply, but there was no such commission. The Quebec Bridge and Railway
                    Company was in charge of the construction and oversight since the very beginning
                    in 1900. From time to time work on the bridge was halted until the Canadian
                    Parliament could appropriate additional funding for construction. </p>
                  <p>What seems clear is that the Quebec Bridge disaster was fundamental to the story
                    Cather wished to tell from the very beginning. It seems equally clear that, in
                    adjusting the facts of the event to suit her purposes, she meant the reader to
                    be sympathetic to her bridge builder and, because he was to die on the Moorlock
                    Bridge, perhaps even see him as a tragic figure. When Alexander learns of the
                    shifting lower chords of the bridge he acts with concern and dispatch. He is the
                    victim of the collapse rather than its haughty perpetrator. He is largely
                    indifferent to his public reputation and material comfort; in fact, his success
                    has given him the feeling of being "built alive into a social structure you
                    don't care a rap about" (13). He is, in effect, a heroic character living in an
                    unheroic time.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her21" target="hen21"/> Labor organizations, petty profit
                    takers, social and charitable obligations, and, finally, desperate and, we are
                    to assume, lesser men who cling to him in the river bring him down. </p>
                  <p>Nothing in the story of the Quebec Bridge catastrophe would have suggested
                    several trips to London, however, or the title character's involvement with an
                    Irish actress. Much of that dimension of the narrative came from an entirely different sort of event. Although Cather had seen the London debut of Synge's
                    <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi> and a performance of Lady Gregory's
                    <hi rend="italic">The Rising of the Moon</hi> during her 1909 trip, that is all we know
                    about Cather's personal acquaintance with the performances of the Irish National
                    Theatre Company.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her22" target="hen22"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The initial purpose of the company, which was established in 1903 but actually
                    had its beginnings, under other names, a few years earlier, was to represent
                    authentic Irish character and culture onstage. The actors and actresses were
                    unpaid amateurs, often performing on makeshift stages and under difficult
                    circumstances throughout the country. Thanks to the philanthropic support of a
                    wealthy Englishwoman, Miss Annie Horniman, the company leased the Abbey Theatre
                    in Dublin. Thereafter they were able to perform their plays in more favorable
                    and professional conditions. Among the important members were George Moore, John
                    Millington Synge, Lady Gregory, and William Butler Yeats, but the entire acting
                    company was united in wishing to avoid caricature, to shun the "stage Irishman,"
                    and to reclaim in dramatic form authentic Irish speech and folk culture. They
                    also wished to avoid a self-conscious "literary taste," preferring to deal with
                    common and local themes and to address directly the Irish people as the true
                    standard of aesthetic judgment. There was some hope as well that the various
                    community performances would help to unite Ireland and promote national
                    independence. For a time there were divisive sentiments in the
                    company&#8212;one group claimed that the dramas should serve largely
                    political purposes, while the other approved of a literary nationalism but thought that artistic excellence
                    was their primary concern. The drama of the Irish National Theatre was
                    regionalist in character and nationalist in outlook at the same time that, in
                    the minds of Yeats, Lady Gregory, and others, it aspired to the highest literary
                    achievement.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her23" target="hen23"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the company first played in London in 1903, a handful of English critics,
                    including drama critic William Archer, praised the performances. After Cather
                    saw <hi rend="italic">The Rising of the Moon</hi> with Archer in 1909, they discussed the brief
                    play's curious simplicity and strange appeal. This conversation apparently made
                    a lasting impression on Cather, for she recalled it many years later in a letter
                    to E. K. Brown (24 January 1947). She had been perplexed by the lack of drama in
                    this short play. Archer explained that anything interesting on the stage is
                    perforce dramatically interesting and belongs there. Cather was to recall that
                    she had learned something important that evening. "All at once," writes James
                    Woodress, Archer "had struck out a foolish platitude she had previously
                    respected devotedly" (207). </p>
                  <p>Archer published an essay in <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> elaborating his ideas about modern
                    drama only a few months later, "The New Drama and the New Theater" (November
                    1909). In this relatively brief essay, he traces the dramatic inheritance of the
                    nineteenth century, locating the primary cause for revolutionary change in the
                    person of Henrik Ibsen. It was not merely Ibsen's realism but his "localism" and
                    his "nationalism"&#8212;the unembarrassed attachment to a dramatic rendering of the familiar&#8212;that made him such an important figure. One of
                    the beneficiaries of Ibsen's revolution was the Irish theater. For Archer,
                    Ibsen's influence could not be underestimated, for it reenergized the
                    drama and in England "meant a declaration of independence from France; just as
                    the progress of American drama, from about 1900, has meant a declaration of
                    independence from both France and England" (10). For Archer, London theatergoers
                    were now forced to look to Dublin or Manchester or even New York for something
                    new and important in the drama. He concludes his essay by recalling his visit to
                    New York in 1907 and discovering this radical change: "[I] saw nothing but plays
                    not only by American authors, but taking firm hold of modern American life,
                    political, social, commercial, domestic, in the East and in the West, in the
                    heart of civilization and on its frontiers" (14). </p>
                  <p>Her conversations with Archer and her reading of his essay might have had
                    contradictory influences upon Cather. On the one hand, as Loretta
                    Wasserman has argued, Archer was forthrightly urging her to remove to London; on
                    the other hand, if she really took his artistic statements to heart, he was
                    suggesting that to be an artist one must return to one's native materials. Synge
                    had faced the same sort of decision; at Yeats's urging, he had left Paris and
                    returned to Ireland, and he began to write about Irish peasant life in Mayo or
                    on the Aran Isles. The success of <hi rend="italic">Riders to the Sea</hi> proved that Yeats was
                    right, but the Irish reaction to <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi> proved that
                    he was notoriously right. </p>
                  <p>When <hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi> debuted in Dublin in 1907, many theatergoers were outraged,
                    and the performances occasioned what are typically known as the "<hi rend="italic">Playboy
                   </hi> riots." Upset theatergoers objected loudly and sometimes violently to its
                    supposed indecency, its coarse language, and its putative theme (parricide); the
                    play depicted Irish life and character in ways that the more refined, or more
                    insecure, Irishman or Irishwoman found scandalous. When the Irish National
                    Theatre performed in the United States in the fall and winter of 1911&#8211;12,
                    Irish Americans reacted similarly to <hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi> in several cities,
                    including New York&#8212;hooting the players offstage, pelting them with
                    rotten vegetables, and the like.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her24" target="hen24"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The London audience was perplexed but not outraged by Synge's play. Whatever she
                    might have thought about the play, Cather found Maire O'Neill, the woman who
                    played Pegeen Mike, particularly interesting. Edith Lewis recalled that Cather
                    thought O'Neill a "gifted young actress . . . whose beauty and engaging
                    personality vividly impressed her" (68). Lewis was perhaps referring to
                    O'Neill's "personality" as a dramatic presence, but it is possible that Cather
                    actually met her. We do not know how much Cather knew about O'Neill's life,
                    though Yeats or Lady Gregory could have given at least an anecdotal biography of
                    her; the ways in which Cather presented the life and background of Hilda may be
                    wholly invention or, as in the case of the Quebec Bridge story, deliberate
                    alteration of the facts to fit her own fictional purposes. </p>
                  <p>We may note the differences. Hilda Burgoyne comes from an acting family; she is originally from rural Ireland, though she grew up in
                    London; she keeps a "mite of a hut in Galway" (49); she sends money home to her
                    sisters and her cousin Mike; the playwright Hugh MacConnell is in love with her;
                    Alexander remembers her as a combination of the "homely and sensible" and the
                    "utterly wild and daft" (30); she plays the donkey girl Peggy in the play <hi rend="italic">Bog
                        Lights</hi>; and Maurice Mainhall says she has "the Irish voice" (24). </p>
                  <p>Maire O'Neill was actually named Molly Allgood; she changed her name because her
                    sister Sara Allgood was an actress in the same company. However, O'Neill did not
                    come from Galway or from an acting family: her parents were working-class
                    Dubliners. She never studied in Paris, but she became famous in the role of
                    Pegeen Mike in <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi>. She was engaged to John
                    Millington Synge, more than twelve years her elder, until his death in early
                    1909, only a few months before Cather saw her perform in London. Perhaps O'Neill
                    recognized that her dramatic success was largely due to her Irish voice. "In
                    dialect she is the one poetical actress our movement has produced," wrote Yeats
                    (654&#8211;55). </p>
                  <p>These two events&#8212;the Quebec Bridge disaster and the dramatic
                    experiments of the Irish National Theatre Company&#8212;were important
                    influences upon Cather's novel. The first Cather knew largely through
                    newspaper accounts; the second had more personal associations. The highly
                    publicized bridge collapse helped shape her plot; Abbey Theatre nationalism and
                    her interest in Maire O'Neill also contributed to the book. Together, the events epitomized the seemingly irreconcilable
                    claims of art and life that characterized so much of Cather's fiction prior to
                    the publication of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her25" target="hen25"/>The
                    oppositions suggested by a successful engineer from the American West and a
                    successful Galway actress were familiar to Cather, but her novel was to deal
                    with this theme far more ambitiously than she had ever attempted before. </p>
                  <p>Bartley Alexander's problem, or one of his problems, is that he is a public man.
                    Alexander is building the largest cantilever bridge in the world; he is
                    internationally famous; he is the desired guest or speaker at important
                    gatherings. He is, for both Lucius Wilson and Winifred Alexander, the one who is
                    building "bridges into the future, over which the feet of every one of us will
                    go" (18). It seems that Alexander has succeeded mightily. But Cather also
                    portrays a second self, an unlived potentiality that refuses to die. In fact, as
                    Alexander complains, this other self "is fighting for his life at the cost of
                    mine" (130). But Cather never lets the reader know what sort of self or
                    aspiration has been denied in him or to what degree his present life is a
                    diminished thing. We know that Alexander studied at the &#200;cole des
                    Beaux-Arts, but we do not know what he was studying. Presumably he was studying
                    architecture, but if one wanted to learn how to build bridges it would have been
                    better to go to Scotland than to Paris, and better still to join the U.S. Army
                    Corps of Engineers, where so many bridge builders, Theodore Cooper included,
                    trained. Alexander is something of an American Everyman, or at least the sort of man the "Sunday Supplement" men wanted for
                    their newspaper articles&#8212;a restless, mechanical force, advancing a
                    materialist, capitalist culture he neither understands nor
                    desires.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her26" target="hen26"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hilda Burgoyne is a success story too. She has succeeded largely through the
                    resources of her attractive personality and her charming Irish voice. If
                    Alexander's life has become hollow and false, as <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> editorial
                    staff apparently wished to emphasize by entitling the novel <hi rend="italic">Alexander's
                        Masquerade</hi>, Hilda's success derives from her straightforward
                    authenticity. She is very much the "fairy child" who has entered the garden
                    walls, but her primitive energy has not been enervated by the trolls. "She's
                    really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see," says Maurice Mainhall; she "makes
                    the whole thing a fairy tale" (24). The plot and the feeling of <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights
                   </hi> depend on "her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the
                    shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, sometimes together, in
                    her mirthful brown eyes" (25). </p>
                  <p>Without extratextual evidence, there is no way of knowing how, or in what order,
                    Cather fused an engineering disaster and the story of a theater company's
                    controversial triumph into a single narrative. What is more certain is that
                    there is a tissue of oppositions in the book. The opposition of the practical
                    world of bridge building to the artistic world of drama lends considerable
                    weight to Susan Rosowski's observation that <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> is "an
                    allegory about art in which Cather explored relationships among the creative
                    energy of the artist, the spiritual world, and the physical one" (35). </p>
                  <p>Some of these oppositions are straightforward. The Victoria and Albert
                    embankments in London or the quays in Paris, built to control and tame the
                    Thames and the Seine, are set against the strong St. Lawrence River or a
                    meandering river with its sandy banks that Alexander recalls from his youth. The
                    Elgin Marbles, testifying to the "lastingness of some things," are in the
                    British Museum, but so is the mummy room, that "ultimate repository of
                    mortality" (32) which so terrifies Alexander. </p>
                  <p>The allusive expression of some of these oppositions is more subtle. Note the
                    songs Cather refers to. In chapter 4, Alexander asks Hilda to sing "The Harp
                    that Once," one of Thomas Moore's songs from <hi rend="italic">Irish Melodies</hi>, which were
                    intended to capture the Irish spirit and did in fact win sympathy for Irish
                    nationalists. The song itself is a lament, for the harp "hangs as mute," "As if
                    that soul were fled,&#8212; / So sleeps the pride of former days,
                    / So glory's thrill is o'er." It is a song, in other words, of the loss of Irish
                    soul as reflected in the loss of music or art. "The Rising of the
                    Moon," the song that Hilda sings in <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights</hi> and which Lady Gregory
                    used in her play by the same name, is not so benign as it might appear, or so
                    poetic as some critics have thought. A celebration of Irish bravery in the
                    rebellion of 1798, it was written several decades later by the nationalist John
                    Keegan Casey while he was in prison. It is a military song, a call to arms and a
                    chant for Irish freedom, whose lyrics include: "Death to every foe and traitor.
                    Onward, strike the marching tune / And hurrah me boys for freedom, it's the
                    rising of the moon" (Gregory n.p.). "The Cloak of Gaul" is playing when Alexander enters the theater to see the final act
                    of <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights</hi>. The actual title of the song is "In the Garb of Old Gaul,"
                    composed by a major in the Black Watch in 1748. It is also fiercely
                    nationalistic and was often used later as a recruitment song: "No effeminate
                    customs our sinews embrace, / No luxurious tables enervate our race; / Our
                    loud-sounding pipe bears the true martial strain, / So do we the old Scottish
                    valor retain" (Graham 112&#8211;13). These songs have nothing to do with
                    bridge building or bridge builders, nor, given the martialism of the lyrics, do
                    they lend a realistic element of Irish charm to the scene. Instead, they
                    reflect Cather's musings on a native and local culture whose folkways
                    and dialect are the stuff of art. </p>
                  <p>Just as the Irish National Theatre Company tried to do away with the stock Irish
                    character, Cather particularly prided herself on her representation of the Swede
                    in <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi> In "My First Novels" she wrote that her novel was "not
                    only about Nebraska farmers, the farmers were Swedes! At that time, 1912, the
                    Swede had never appeared on the printed page in this country except in broadly
                    humorous sketches; and the humor was based on two peculiarities: his physical
                    strength, and his inability to pronounce the letter 'j'. I had certainly good
                    reason for supposing that the book I had written for myself would remain
                    faithfully with me, and continue to be exclusively my property"
                    (94&#8211;95). Cather may have been somewhat disingenuous in that last
                    remark, since William Archer and her own experience had convinced her that a
                    faithful rendering of the local was actually the future of a reinvigorated art. </p>

                  <head type="main" rend="center-italic">Literary Models</head>
                  <p>Since John Hinz's brief essay on the novel in 1950, several literary sources and
                    influences for <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> have been nominated, but we
                    are particularly interested in those influences that may have
                    contributed in some measure to the genesis and composition of the book. This is
                    an appropriate emphasis, because as Bernice Slote, James Woodress, and others
                    have noted, after <hi rend="italic">The Professor's House</hi> (1925), <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge
                   </hi> is psychologically the most autobiographical of Cather's novels. Generally,
                    these influences are of two sorts: those that contribute to the
                    creation of character and psychological motives, and those that contribute to
                    plot and narrative texture. </p>
                  <p>Cather herself confessed she was too much under the sway of Wharton and James
                    when she wrote the novel, though her comments indicate the influence
                    of a literary manner, not specific textual sources. Hinz briefly notes
                    the Jamesian qualities in <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>: "The international
                    flavor, the genteel drawing rooms, the Boston-London axis of the
                    story, and above all the painstaking analysis of motive and dissection of
                    character are manifestly Jamesian" (473). Bernice Slote nominates Anthony Bream
                    in James's <hi rend="italic">The Other House</hi> as a possible model for Bartley Alexander and
                    notes that Cather reviewed James's novel in 1896, but she also believes that it
                    is wrong to describe the novel as "Jamesian" (xvii; see also viii n. 3). We
                    might also surmise that James's "The Jolly Corner" (1908), with its emphasis on
                    a dreaded and ghostly alter ego, had something to do with Alexander's
                    psychology. </p>
                  <p>Cather's novel is filled with Whartonian ironies, such as the wet and illegible
                    letter Alexander wrote but never mailed to Winifred announcing his love for
                    Hilda, but which his wife takes as evidence of devotion to her, or his statement
                    to Philip Horton that "Anything I do can be made public" (110). Tonally,
                    Cather's ironies are seldom so wry or comically pungent as Wharton's, but
                    perhaps Wharton's suggestion in <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth</hi> (1905) that Lily Bart
                    is psychologically pursued by the Furies has some parallel in Cather's novel.
                    Both Cather and Wharton were interested in myth, and L. V. Jacks and Bernice
                    Slote believe that the love triangle between Paris (also known as Alexander),
                    his wife, Oenone, and Helen of Troy may have contributed to Cather's conception
                    of the love triangle she was developing in the novel. James Woodress has
                    reaffirmed those correspondences and added that Keats's <hi rend="italic">Endymion</hi> might
                    have contributed to the moon imagery that Slote locates in Greek and Roman myth
                    and in Cather's novel (220). </p>
                  <p>Elizabeth Ammons sees Cather working with a different sort of myth&#8212;"the
                    energizing myth of American manhood, nationhood, and empire" (748). She
                    instances an abundance of essays published in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">Harper's</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, and, of course, <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> that
                    celebrated engineers, and often bridge builders, as providing social and
                    cultural background for the novel. To this list she adds the possible
                    influences of Rudyard Kipling's "The Bridge Builders" (1894), Richard
                    Harding Davis's <hi rend="italic">Soldiers of Fortune</hi> (1897), Harold Bell Wright's <hi rend="italic">The
                    Winning of Barbara Worth</hi> (1911), and the personal and published example of that epitome of masculinity, Theodore Roosevelt. These
                    essays and fictions, according to Ammons, indicate the "well-developed backdrop
                    of literature and cultural mythology" associated with "conquest of the
                    environment, expansion of Anglo hegemony, and veneration of the Wild masculine
                    West" (754). However, according to Ammons, Cather undertook to "demythologize"
                    this myth in much the same way that Viola Roseboro's story "The Mistaken Man"
                    (1907) did. Ammons speculates that Roseboro's story of a bridge disaster
                    provided the "spark" for Cather's novel: the bridge builder in "The Mistaken
                    Man" also works reluctantly but uncomplainingly under cost-cutting pressures;
                    his bridge collapses, taking with it a trainload of Sunday School children. </p>
                  <p>Marilee Lindemann has identified the influence of Frank Norris's
                        <hi rend="italic">McTeague</hi>, though not in regard to the "second self " that bedevils
                    both McTeague and Alexander. And, though they are not literary sources per se,
                    Lindemann argues that Cather may have been influenced in a negative or
                    ambivalent way by the writings of Theodore Roosevelt and Jane Addams. E. K.
                    Brown, while recognizing that Cather tempered the violent emotions found there,
                    suggests that Robert Louis Stevenson's <hi rend="italic">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</hi> may have
                    served as a source for her protagonist. However, Cather's fiction, both before
                    and after the publication of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, is so saturated with the
                    theme of a divided self that this line of inquiry can only generally be related
                    to the process of composition of the novel. </p>
                  <p>Susan Rosowski has discerned traces of Wordsworth, Keats, and Tennyson's "The
                    Lady of Shallott" in the novel, but she also notes that at points Cather drops
                    her authorial persona and "experiments in the manner of the French symbolists,
                    using language rich in synaesthesia to evoke a private mood in which the present
                    moment hangs suspended" (37). As evidence for this quality she instances two
                    richly descriptive passages, both deriving from Cather's experience in London.
                    This is an especially rich vein of inquiry. Despite their incidental relation to
                    plot or to character development, these passages often give energy and emotional
                    color to the story out of proportion to the events they dramatize. This also
                    helps to explain the patterned allusions that seem to disclose and underwrite an
                    intellectual complex, a tension between the nationalistic art of "localism" of
                    the Irish theater (suggested by passing references to songs whose titles were
                    benign but whose lyrics were militant) and the august embodiment of a universal
                    world culture (hence mention of the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum). T. S.
                    Eliot, also influenced by French symbolism, developed an analogous
                    technique at that time.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her27" target="hen27"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>A final strand of literary influence may offer some clues about
                    Cather's approach to her material. As has often been noted, Cather reviewed
                    Kipling's volume of stories <hi rend="italic">The Day's Work</hi> (1898) in the <hi rend="italic">Pittsburgh
                        Leader</hi> in February 1899. Of the writer in general, she said, "The world
                    has been a great many centuries in evolving its present gigantic industries, but
                    Mr. Kipling is the first man who has ever written of them seriously or sympathetically" (<hi rend="italic">World and the Parish</hi> 2: 557). Kipling, she
                    wrote, "finds energy the most wonderful and terrible and beautiful thing in the
                    universe" and has made energy "the subject matter for art" (558). Included in
                        <hi rend="italic">The Day's Work</hi> was the story "The Bridge Builders," about an engineer
                    building a bridge over the Ganges, a man who, in Cather's words, "built his life
                    into the bridge" (558). </p>
                  <p>Readers of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> were made to understand, largely through the
                    comments of Cather's Jamesian ficelle, Lucius Wilson, that Alexander, too, had
                    built his life into the Moorlock Bridge: 
                        <q rend="block">
                        <p>"I'm sure I did you justice in the matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel
                    that there was a weak spot where someday strain would tell. Even after you began
                    to climb, I stood down in the crowd and watched you with&#8212;well not with
                    confidence. The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your
                    fa&#231;ade rose, the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from
                    top to bottom,"&#8212;he indicated its course in the air with his
                    forefinger,&#8212;"then a crash and clouds of dust." (12&#8211;13)</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parallels between material stress (on the lower chord of the Moorlock Bridge)
                    and psychological stress (the foundation of Alexander's being) imply the
                    inevitable collapse of both. </p>
                  <p>As Merrill Skaggs points out, such locutions as a "crack zigzagging from top to
                    bottom" suggest that Cather borrowed some of her inspiration from Poe,
                    especially from "The Fall of the House of Usher." The passage quoted above, and others scattered throughout the novel, show how Cather meant to
                    connect, symbolically, the fates of creator and creation. </p>
                  <p>For this reason, Hinz's brief identification of Ibsen's <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder
                   </hi> as a literary model is provocative, even beyond the claims Hinz makes for
                    it: "A great builder grows old reluctantly; he becomes infatuated with
                    Hilda&#8212;the symbol of his loss; he plans one last triumphant work; he
                    suffers a fall from his own great structure. . . . It is not at all unlikely
                    that she unconsciously drew upon her earlier readings to lend her novel its
                    pattern" (473&#8211;74). Hinz adds only that Cather wrote an essay on Ibsen
                    for <hi rend="italic">Hesperian</hi> (1 November 1892).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her28" target="hen28"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other parallels between the two works, however. Halvard Solness, the
                    master builder, has achieved greatly and unexpectedly. He was a poor boy from a
                    rural village who rose to the top of his profession. Because he is largely
                    self-taught he is not called an architect, but he has prospered through his own
                    ambition, through the aid of circumstances and "luck" (what he rather
                    mysteriously calls his supernatural "helpers" in the
                    world).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her29" target="hen29"/>Dogged by a vague fear that he will be
                    dethroned by the younger generation, Solness sometimes thinks he is mad. He
                    believes there is a "troll" inside him that has caused his good fortune but will
                    also turn against him in time. For Hilda, the origin of Solness's problem is
                    that he has a "sickly conscience": "I mean your conscience is
                    feeble&#8212;too delicately built, as it were&#8212; hasn't strength to
                    take a grip of things&#8212;to lift and bear what is heavy" (299). Solness
                    is attracted to Hilda because she is youthful, an emissary from the younger generation he so fears. She is to be his
                    "princess," and his future constructions will be castles in the air with "firm"
                    foundations.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her30" target="hen30"/>It is Hilda who says the master
                    builder "cannot climb as high as he builds" (315); she urges him to climb the
                    tower of a new house he has built for his wife. Solness, claiming he can no
                    longer live without joy, climbs the scaffolding with expectant purpose in his
                    life, but, becoming dizzy, falls to his death. </p>
                  <p>Ibsen's play provided Cather with an imaginative example of dramatic contrast
                    between two different activities: the building of a bridge and a romantic
                    involvement with a woman perhaps not so coincidentally named Hilda. Furthermore,
                    details in Ibsen's play would have been suggestive to Cather: a builder
                    wrestling with some internal "troll"; a man whose conscience is too weak for the
                    burdens placed upon it; marriage to an elegant woman whose attachments to duty
                    seem stronger than life with her husband; a spontaneous young woman who
                    reanimates the joy within a successful man but drives him to destruction. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, Cather, through her acquaintance with William Archer, had a more tangible
                    link to Ibsen's dramas than when she wrote her college essay on Ibsen. The only
                    English translation of Ibsen's plays available to Cather was by William Archer
                    and Edmund Gosse. Archer was among the earliest and most prolific of Ibsen's
                    champions, translating Ibsen's complete works and writing many essays and books
                    about the man. If Cather read <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> in the English edition
                    of Ibsen's <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> (1906&#8211;12), she might have also read Archer's introduction to the play. There she would have learned about
                    the play's genesis and also about the originality of Ibsen's method and subject
                    matter. Archer considered <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> the most autobiographical of
                    Ibsen's works,<ref type="editorial" xml:id="her31" target="hen31"/>and one filled with symbolism. But
                    he insisted that it was a mistake to think of the play as purely symbolic.
                    "There is nothing in the play which has no meaning on the natural-psychological
                    plane, and absolutely requires a symbolic interpretation to make it
                    comprehensible," he wrote. "It is true that, in order to accept the action on
                    what we may call the realistic level, we must suppose Solness to possess and to
                    exercise, sometimes in spite of himself, and sometimes unconsciously, a
                    considerable measure of hypnotic power. But the time is surely past when we
                    could reckon hypnotism among 'supernatural' phenomena" (xxxii). </p>
                  <p>Whether or not Cather got them from Archer, these two critical observations are
                    pertinent to <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>. The St. Lawrence River, the mummy room
                    in the British Museum, the Moorlock Bridge, London&#8212;even Hilda and
                    Alexander&#8212;exist in their own right, but they also function as symbols
                    in a narrative that Ferris Greenslet, at least, thought was informed by a
                    "spiritual sense of life." Perhaps this is why critics have been able to speak,
                    by turns and in uncontradictory ways, about the novel as realistic,
                    naturalistic, allegorical, or symbolist. </p>
                  <p>Archer's second point is also germane because, even as a youth, Alexander exerted
                    a powerful mystery and energy. This is true not only for Professor Wilson but also for Alexander's schoolmates;
                    not only for Winifred, who asks Wilson to explain the man by recalling his
                    youth, but also for Hilda; not only for London colleagues but also for the
                    Sunday Supplement journalists. If the audience does not accept Ibsen's
                    investment in Solness of "hypnotic power," says Archer, the originality and
                    spiritual power of <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> will simply disappear. One might
                    say the same about Bartley Alexander. This helps to explain Wilson's final
                    comment in the epilogue: "He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He
                    belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at
                    the best" (126). Ibsen's drama also helps to explain Wilson's comment about
                    Alexander in the opening chapter. There, Wilson imagines himself an onlooker
                    who, like the spectators at the end of <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi>, anxiously
                    watches the protagonist climb ever higher, with a foretaste of catastrophe. </p>
                  <p>If Cather had read <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> in the 1893 edition, she would have
                    encountered an introduction where Archer made an analogous point. To demonstrate
                    that this hypnotic quality was not at all incredible, he retold the story of
                    Solness but relocated the play in England and made the builder a journalist.
                    Archer would have shown Cather, in a brief way, how translatable Ibsen's story
                    was. If this drama&#8212;this "soul history," to use Archer's
                    phrase&#8212;could as easily be about a London journalist as a builder in
                    Norway, could it not also be about a Boston engineer? </p>

               <div3 type="section">
                  <head type="main" rend="center-italic">Publication and Reception</head>
                  <p>As Ferris Greenslet noted in his reader's report, S. S. McClure had taken a
                    personal hand in advertising the story in his magazine. In <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi>,
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Masquerade</hi> appeared in three installments with five
                    illustrations by F. Graham Cootes; one illustration appeared on the cover of the
                    magazine that contained the first installment. Marilee Lindemann finds this
                    cover illustration "garish" and notes that it curiously pictures a seductive
                    Hilda in the role of Peggy in <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights</hi>, thus misrepresenting the
                    subject matter of the novel. All of the illustrations are somewhat romantic, but
                    those in the text do emphasize Alexander instead of Hilda. Lindemann believes
                    the cover painting "tries to place Cather's story within the conventional
                    framework of the adultery novel" (xiv). </p>
                  <p>The illustration does suggest a certain eroticism (Hilda is barefoot and
                    seductively looking up at the audience), but if McClure superintended the
                    illustrations he might have had something more calculating in mind. To the
                    degree that the painting is reminiscent of <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi>,
                    he might have been trying to capitalize on the recent notoriety of Synge's play
                    and the U.S. tour of the Irish National Theatre Company. In the <hi rend="italic">New York
                        Times</hi> alone, twenty-three articles appeared between October 1911 and
                    January 1912 on the "<hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi> riots" and attendant circumstances. Yeats
                    and Moncure Conway published defenses of the play, and Lady Gregory rather
                    shrewdly and dramatically had Theodore Roosevelt attend the play as her personal
                    guest. Most of the detractors, on the other hand, thought the play was indecent and an offense to
                    Irish morality and character. From the cover illustration, the unsuspecting
                    reader might have anticipated an altogether different sort of story than the one
                    Cather wrote, but it would have generated interest in the story nonetheless. </p>
                  <p>Greenslet's original suggestion that the publisher might use the illustrations in
                        <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> was abandoned, except that one was reprinted on the dust
                    jacket above the publisher's description of the novel. In a sense, this
                    publisher's blurb was the first review of the novel. Several of the phrases
                    Greenslet had used in his original reader's report are repeated there. Not only
                    does the description emphasize the resemblance to Wharton's fiction, but it uses
                    such phrases as "dramatic, powerful, and haunting to the memory" and "marked ... by 
                    the qualities of distinction, of excellence of workmanship, perceptiveness,
                    actuality, and the spiritual sense of life." </p>
                  <p>The reviews were generally favorable and tended to repeat the views, and
                    sometimes the same language, that the publisher had advanced in its
                    announcement&#8212;that it was an important first novel, reminiscent of
                    Wharton, and that it demonstrated commendable craft and emotional restraint. The
                    reviewer for <hi rend="italic">Living Age</hi> wrote, "Willa S. Cather has given the world an
                    exceedingly finished piece of work, and a story which haunts the memory," and
                    observed that, though its theme was intense, the author handled it with
                    "refinement and distinction": "there is no hint of sordidness, and the pathos is
                    never unrestrained" (192). A reviewer for <hi rend="italic">Current</hi>
                     <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi>
                    detected "great artistic skill" in the book, "brilliant in its
                    reflections of character and life, and admirably restrained and
                    graceful in form and diction" (338). </p>
                  <p>A writer for the <hi rend="italic">New York Times Book Review</hi> characterized the book in much
                    the same way that Cather herself would in "My First Novels": "There are dramatic
                    situations, much clever conversation, and some graphic description. Miss Cather
                    has a faculty . . . of catching and describing in terse, refined phrase the
                    salient features of personality, both mental and physical" (295). An
                        <hi rend="italic">Athen&#230;um</hi> reviewer for the British edition of the novel was
                    much more succinct; the novel was "interesting" and the story was told with
                    "some force" (217). Only the reviewer in the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> was dismissive,
                    saying, "We sometimes doubt whether it is a compliment after all to be likened
                    in literary style to Mrs. Wharton." While there is some feeling in the story,
                    the reviewer thought that, "as a novel, it all seems rather futile" (47). </p>
                  <p>The review in <hi rend="italic">Current Literature</hi> summarized newspaper comments on the
                    novel before offering its own opinion, noting that the <hi rend="italic">Louisville
                        Courier-Journal</hi> had called it a "portrait group . . . in which the
                    personages are presented with such intensity, with such feeling for character,
                    as to make the canvas lose a moment its static quality, the figures seem but
                    caught a moment in the scene of a drama" (337). The <hi rend="italic">Providence Journal
                   </hi> commented that "only readers as finely sensitive as the author will
                    appreciate it"; and the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi> praised its compact energy and
                    grace and thought it might instruct other novelists in the "power and
                    blessedness of simplicity" (337). The reviewer then observed that the story was loosely based on
                    the Quebec Bridge disaster but praised the author's "individualism and her
                    determination to use social and industrial conditions for her own purposes as an
                    artist" (338). </p>
                  <p>Only two of the reviews of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> were signed. Margaret
                    Sherwood, whose novels were also published by Houghton Mifflin, wrote
                    a lengthy review essay for <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> entitled "Some Recent
                    Fiction." The essay begins with a lament that modern fiction is overburdened
                    with complexities. She regrets the loss of the ballad's power and simplicity,
                    and, in a remark prefiguring the most famous phrase in Cather's essay "The Novel
                    D&#233;meubl&#233;," writes, "As much by what is left unsaid as by
                    what is said, the imagination is set stirring" (680). Sherwood has relatively
                    little to say about Cather's novel, but what she does say is wholly
                    complimentary: "One finds in <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> a welcome contrast to the
                    over-emotional tales. . . . [T]here is a steady and harmonious development of
                    plot and character, a dignity and reticence in the treatment of the dramatic
                    scenes. The author's workmanship is deft and skillful, and the swift, clean
                    stroke tells on every page" (683). </p>
                  <p>H. L. Mencken's review is more surly and robust. In the present day, Mencken
                    says, there are two schools of fiction&#8212; "The School of Plot and the
                    School of Piffle" (156). But Cather as an artist has the intelligence
                    to "aim higher," and <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> proves to be a "very promising
                    piece of writing" (156). If she has chosen to follow Wharton, there are worse choices she might have made, for Wharton at least is an artist. Mencken
                    commends Cather's style, her dialogue, and her pictures of "the cold Winifred"
                    and the "alluring Hilda." Her treatment of Alexander, too, is good, or at least
                    good enough, but by having him drown at the end Cather evades the problem of the
                    book and sidesteps the realism of the situation. The average man, says Mencken,
                    would have let the situation "drift" and settled into a complacent role as lover
                    of two women separated by an ocean. </p>
                  <p>It is probably true that the first novel by any writer not content to write
                    formula fiction is, in a way, experimental. Certainly, Cather's diverse
                    materials and literary models indicate her ambition. It is probably true, as
                    well, that looking back upon that first novel, with the full confidence of an
                    achieved mastery of one's craft, Cather felt a twinge of embarrassment about her
                    beginnings. Nevertheless, the novel went through five printings, and she agreed
                    to write a preface for the 1922 reissue of the novel (albeit an apologetic one).
                    Perhaps she liked the novel more than she was willing to admit. Later readers,
                    at any rate, have been kinder to the book than she was. Edith Lewis reread it
                    after Cather's death and was surprised at the intensity of feeling in it. E. K.
                    Brown, Bernice Slote, James Woodress, and others have recognized its limitations
                    but have admired it still. Marilee Lindemann has called it a "minor 'classic"'
                    (vii). </p>
                  <p>To the extent that the novel represents the unavoidable and tentative first step
                    toward Cather's later works, its significance ought not be undervalued. In her
                    1922 preface to <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, Cather herself promoted the belief that a belated
                    obedience to Sarah Orne Jewett's advice prompted her return to the "home
                    pasture" and the creation of <hi rend="italic">O Pioneers!</hi>: "Of course, one day you will
                    write about your own country. In the meantime, get all you can" (vii). Whether
                    or not Jewett pointed the way for Cather's artistic development, what Cather got
                    from the world at large was not merely a congeries of literary techniques and a
                    rather artificial sophistication. Her literary aspirations were high ones.
                    James, Wharton, the symbolists, Ibsen, Synge&#8212;these were literary
                    examples of a rare order. And in a sense their examples, as artists, were the
                    same. Henry James truly was a world citizen; he was born in New York, but he
                    claimed his earliest memory was of the Place de Vend&#244;me in Paris. But,
                    by 1904, even James had come home to take stock of his native land, publishing
                        <hi rend="italic">The American Scene</hi> in 1907. It was James, too, after reading
                    Wharton's <hi rend="italic">The Valley of Indecision</hi>, a novel set in eighteenth-century
                    Italy, who believed Wharton should be "tethered in native pastures" and advised
                    that she take up her "American subject," and "<hi rend="italic">Do New York!</hi>" (Edel 580).
                    The result was <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth</hi>. Ibsen and Synge had lived and studied
                    in the cultural capitals of Europe, but they too came home, to Christiania,
                    Norway, or the Aran Isles of Ireland, for imaginative sustenance and a subject
                    matter that truly belonged to them. The lives of the writers Cather deeply
                    admired told the same story. <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> was an ambitious
                    experiment which moved her that much more quickly and securely into her own
                    literary territory, not because she was reacting against that first novel but because it set in motion imaginative
                    energies that would eventually take her there. </p>

                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen4" target="her4" n="4">Many of Cather's early stories deal with the failure to grow into one's best
                    nature. Together, these stories dramatize her interest in, and perhaps her
                    personal fear of, arrested development. "Jack-a-Boy" (1901), "The Professor's
                    Commencement" (1902), "The Treasure of Far Island" (1902), "A Death in the
                    Desert" (1903), "The Garden Lodge" (1905), "Paul's Case" (1905), "Eleanor's
                    House" (1907), "The Profile" (1907), "The Willing Muse" (1907), and "On the
                    Gull's Road" (1908) share the common theme of a failure to grow into one's full
                    capacities, often through an irrational attachment to the past and to one's youth. In "The Treasure
                    of Far Island," Cather says that Margie Van Dyck has failed to "grow up"
                        (<hi rend="italic">Collected Short Fiction</hi> 281), that she is a case of "arrested
                    development" (273). The latter phrase, it should be remembered, was, in the
                    early years of the twentieth century, understood to be a biological, even
                    Darwinian, term, not a psychological one. </note>

                        is so, Cather's picture of Synge must have come from reading or from
                        anecdote, since he had died earlier in 1909. </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen15" target="her15" n="15"> Also in this chapter, Alexander's recollection of his visits to the
                        British Museum has a certain specificity of detail as well as mood. Cather
                        in a 1925 interview gave a "word portrait" of Charles Algernon Swinburne,
                        whom she said she met in the British Museum: "His stringy blond hair stayed
                        horribly young when he was old, giving the uncanny effect that one could see
                        repeated in the mummy room of the museum where they met" (Bohlke 83). It is quite possible that, given the mortuary quality of Swinburne's
                    appearance, so in contrast to the Watts painting of the man in his youth, which
                    Cather also recalled, this meeting evoked in Cather the same sort of dread of
                    lost youth that Alexander feels when in the mummy room. Swinburne died 10 April
                    1909, so the meeting probably took place during her 1902 visit. </note>

                        nearly 150 people (mostly young women) dead; it provided Cather with the

                        the contemporaneous adulation of raw energy that Henry Adams so movingly
                        comments upon in his <hi rend="italic">Education</hi>. In fact, Bernice Slote speculates in
                        her introduction to <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> that Cather might have come in
                        contact with that privately printed book (xvi). That is possible, but it
                        would not have been necessary in the intellectual atmosphere of the day.
                        Howard Mumford Jones named his cultural history of the United States between
                        1865 and 1915 <hi rend="italic">The Age of Energy</hi> (1970); Ronald E. Martin's study of
                        the same period is entitled <hi rend="italic">American Literature and the Universe of Force
                       </hi> (1981). Insofar as the official scientific view of the world at that
                        time posited only two immutable ingredients in the entire
                        universe&#8212;energy and matter&#8212;force was a part of the
                        ethos of the culture, and Bartley Alexander's restless energy mirrors that
                        ethos at the same time that it bedevils him.</note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen27" target="her27" n="27">Cather might have been familiar with Arthur Symons's <hi rend="italic">The Symbolist
                            Movement in Literature</hi> (1899). She seems to be referring to Symons
                        when she writes that Maurice Mainhall had written a book on the poetry of
                        Ernest Dowson. See the Explanatory Notes. </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen28" target="her28" n="28">Since <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> was first performed in January 1893,
                        neither the 1892 essay nor Cather's reading in Ibsen at this time could have
                        had anything to do with this play. Many years later, Zo&#234; Akins
                        wrote to Cather about <hi rend="italic">Lucy Gayheart</hi>. In her response (19 April 1935),
                        Cather conceded Akins's observation that there were echoes of <hi rend="italic">The Master
                            Builder</hi> in the novel but added that what was best in the story was
                        her own. </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen29" target="her29" n="29">It is the force of personality in Solness that, mysteriously, creates the
                        lucky circumstances that pave the way to his rise; this supernatural quality
                        leads him to call them "helpers." Cather herself might have been thinking of
                        this facet of <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> when she wrote <hi rend="italic">The Song of the
                            Lark</hi> (1915). In her preface to the 1933 issue of the novel, she
                        wrote of Thea's rise: "What I cared about, and still care about, was the
                        girl's escape; the play of blind chance, the way in which commonplace
                        occurrences fell together to liberate her from commonness. She seemed wholly
                        at the mercy of accident; but to persons of her vitality and honesty,
                        fortunate accidents will always happen" (iii). Alexander's rise is likewise
                        fortuitous. He benefits from McKellar's terminal illness as well as from
                        McKellar's acquaintance with Mrs. Pemberton, Winifred's aunt.</note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen30" target="her30" n="30">Alexander, too, yearns for the romance of an earlier day. He tells Hilda,
                        "you can love as queens did, in the old time" (101). </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="hen31" target="her31" n="31">According to Archer, the several constructions of Solness represent
                        Ibsen's own plays: the churches represent his early romantic plays, the
                        houses for human habitation are his social dramas, and the "castles in the
                        air" he resolves to build at the end represent the spiritual dramas Ibsen
                        was then writing. The fact that Solness is building a new house for himself
                        may hint at Cather's own very autobiographical novel, <hi rend="italic">The Professor's
                            House</hi> (1925), which both Slote and Woodress see as somewhat of a
                        reworking of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>. Certainly Alexander's simultaneous
                        construction of several bridges, including the Moorlock Bridge, and his
                        resentment that he is being absorbed into a social structure he does not
                        care about serve as analogues to Cather's harried activities at

            <p>It is difficult to comply with the publisher's request that I write a preface for
                    this new edition of an early book. "Alexander's Bridge" was my first novel, and
                    does not deal with the kind of subject-matter in which I now find myself most at
                    home. The people and the places of the story interested me intensely at the time
                    when it was written, because they were new to me and were in themselves
                    attractive. "Alexander's Bridge" was written in 1911, and "O Pioneers!" the
                    following year. The difference in quality in the two books is an illustration of
                    the fact that it is not always easy for the inexperienced writer to distinguish
                    between his own material and that which he would like to make his own.
                    Everything is new to the young writer, and everything seems equally personal.
                    That which is outside his deepest experience, which he observes and studies,
                    often seems more vital than that which he knows well, because he regards it with
                    all the excitement of discovery. The things he knows best he takes for granted,
                    since he is not continually thrilled by new discoveries about them. They lie at the bottom of his consciousness, whether he is aware of it or
                    no, and they continue to feed him, but they do not stimulate him. </p>
            <p>There is a time in a writer's development when his "life line" and the line of
                    his personal endeavor meet. This may come early or late, but after it occurs his
                    work is never quite the same. After he has once or twice done a story that
                    formed itself, inevitably, in his mind, he will not often turn back to the
                    building of external stories again. The inner feeling produces for him a deeper
                    excitement than the thrill of novelty or the glitter of the passing show. </p>
            <p>The writer, at the beginning of his career, is often more interested in his
                    discoveries about his art than in the homely truths which have been about him
                    from his cradle. He is likely to feel that writing is one of the most important
                    things, if not the most important thing, in the world, and that what he learns
                    about it is his one really precious possession. He understands, of course, that
                    he must know a great deal about life, but he thinks this knowledge is something
                    he can get by going out to look for it, as one goes to a theatre. Perhaps it is
                    just as well for him to believe this until he has acquired a little facility and
                    strength of hand; to work through his youthful vanities and gaudy extravagances
                    before he comes to deal with the material that is truly his own. One of the few
                    really helpful words I ever heard from an older writer, I had from Sarah Orne
                    Jewett when she said to me: "Of course, one day you will write about your own
                    country. In the meantime, get all you can. One must know the world <hi rend="italic">so well</hi> before one can know the
                    parish." </p>
            <p>There have been notable and beautiful exceptions, but I think usually the young
                    writer must have his affair with the external material he covets; must imitate
                    and strive to follow the masters he most admires, until he finds he is starving
                    for reality and cannot make this go any longer. Then he learns that it is not
                    the adventure he sought, but the adventure that sought him, which has made the
                    enduring mark upon him. </p>
            <p>When a writer once begins to work with his own material, he realizes that, no
                    matter what his literary excursions may have been, he has been working with it
                    from the beginning&#8212; by living it. With this material he is another
                    writer. He has less and less power of choice about the moulding of it. It seems
                    to be there of itself, already moulded. If he tries to meddle with its vague
                    outline, to twist it into some categorical shape, above all if he tries to adapt
                    or modify its mood, he destroys its value. In working with this material he
                    finds that he need have little to do with literary devices; he comes to depend
                    more and more on something else&#8212;the thing by which our feet find the
                    road home on a dark night, accounting of themselves for roots and stones which
                    we had never noticed by day. This guide is not always with him, of course. He
                    loses it and wanders. But when it is with him it corresponds to what Mr. Bergson
                    calls the wisdom of intuition as opposed to that of intellect. With this to
                    shape his course, a writer contrives and connives only as regards mechanical details, and questions of effective presentation, always debatable. About the
                    essential matter of his story he cannot argue this way or that; he has seen it,
                    has been enlightened about it in flashes that are as unreasoning,
                    often as unreasonable, as life itself. </p>

            <note type="editorial" xml:id="en1" target="r1" n="1">Cather's first novel was published as <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Masquerade</hi> in three
                    Title installments in <hi rend="italic">McClure's Magazine</hi>: February 1912 (chaps.
                    1&#8211;3), March 1912 (chaps. 4&#8211;7), and April 1912 (chaps.
                    8&#8211;10 and Epilogue). This first title recalls two other works of the
                    period: <hi rend="italic">The Masquerader</hi>, a novel by Katherine Cecil Thurston (New York:
                    Harper, 1904); and <hi rend="italic">The Masqueraders: A Play in Four Acts</hi>, by Henry Arthur
                    Jones (New York: Samuel French, 1909). Apart from the titles and a few
                    incidental correspondences, however, these works have little in common with
                    Cather's novel. Both are similar to what Cather called a "studio
                    picture"&#8212;taking place in drawing rooms and filled with animated and
                    clever conversation. E. K. Brown surmises (116 n. 1) that the title
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Masquerade</hi> was the invention of the magazine staff, since
                    Cather had referred to the book as <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> as early as
                    November 1911. Perhaps not so coincidentally, the newest and largest bridge in
                    Paris when Cather first visited the city was Pont Alexandre (Alexander Bridge),
                    completed in 1900. </note>

                    university: There is no known prototype for this character, though Kari Ronning
                    has suggested that Cather's recollections of a psychology professor from the
                    University of Nebraska, Harry Kirke Wolfe (1858&#8211;1918), might have
                    contributed something to his character. The scholar who takes an interest in a
                    youthful and talented student is a recurring figure in Cather's fiction. One
                    thinks of Professor Godfrey St. Peter and Tom Outland of <hi rend="italic">The Professor's
                        House</hi>, surely, and Professor Emerson Graves in "The Professor's

                        (<hi rend="italic">Collected Short Fiction</hi> 287). But there are other characters who fit
                    this pattern as well, such as the music teacher Wunsch and his student Thea

                    working on Georgine Milmine's manuscript on the life of Mary Baker Eddy. At

                    Sarah Orne Jewett, who lived with Mrs. Fields part of the year. Cather often
                    visited for tea and conversation and wrote an essay about the experience, "148

               <p>Bartley: There is no known prototype for Bartley Alexander. Although
                    Cather adopted the circumstances and behavior of the consulting engineer for the
                    Quebec Bridge, she did not model Alexander on Theodore Cooper. At the time of
                    the bridge disaster, Cooper was sixty-eight years old and in poor health. </p>
               <p>Bartley Alexander's name recalls that of Hartley Burr Alexander, a former
                    classmate of Cather's at the University of Nebraska and evidently in her mind
                    when she wrote the novel. He received a Ph.D. from Columbia University and in
                    1908 became professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska. While the
                    character's name may derive from Hartley Alexander, his circumstances more
                    closely resemble Lucius Wilson's.</p>
               <p>The name itself has a certain suggestiveness. Bernice Slote noted correspondences
                    between Bartley Alexander's personal situation and that of Alexander (Paris),
                    who preferred Helen over his wife; in both instances, personal desires had
                    significant and disastrous public consequences (xvii&#8211;xviii). The name
                    may also recall Alexander the Great, who in crossing the Hellespont began his
                    ambitious campaign for domination of the known world.</p>

                    Alexander's psychological dilemma, expressed here, is reminiscent of a passage
                    from Henri Bergson's <hi rend="italic">Creative Evolution</hi>. Cather had read this book at
                    least by September 1912, when she wrote to Elizabeth Sergeant agreeing with her
                    enthusiastic response to the book, and probably much earlier. She could have
                    read the English translation in 1911 or the French edition as early as 1907.
                    Alternatively, she might have read one of any number of digests of Bergsonism.
                    The following passage from Bergson relates to Alexander's desire for all the
                    "birds in the bushes": 
                <q rend="block">Each of us glancing back over his history, will find that his child-personality,
                    though indivisible, united in itself divers persons, which could remain blended
                    just because they were in a nascent state: this indecision, so charged with
                    promise, is one of the greatest charms of childhood. But these interwoven
                    personalities become incompatible in the course of growth, and, as each of us
                    can live but one life, a choice must perforce be made. We choose in reality
                    without ceasing; without ceasing, also, we abandon many things. The route we
                    pursue in time is strewn with the remains of all that we began to be, of all
                    that we might have become. (99&#8211;100) </q>

                    had the impressionist critic and poet Arthur Symons (1865&#8211;1945)
                    particularly in mind. While no book on the "Poetry of Ernest Dowson" is listed
                    in the National Union Catalogue, Symons did publish an edition of Ernest
                    Dowson's poetry in 1909 and had included a chapter on the man in <hi rend="italic">Studies in

                    a composite figure based on John Millington Synge and James M. Barrie, with
                    perhaps a touch of W. B. Yeats as well (217). Synge created the part of Pegeen
                    Mike that Maire O'Neill made her own; MacConnell has created a similar part in
                        <hi rend="italic">Bog Lights</hi> for Hilda Burgoyne. Also, though it is one-sided, there is
                    a love interest between MacConnell and Hilda, and Synge and O'Neill were engaged
                    at the time of his death. Additionally, since Synge died a few months before the
                    London tour, his play was directed by Norreys Connell; perhaps Cather derived
                    the name of her fictional director and playwright from him. Though a Hugh F.
                    O'Connell had published his objections to the supposed authenticity of Yeats's
                    Celtic dramas, it seems unlikely that Cather would have known of this man. </note>

                     fuel the title probably refers to the light cast by burning bog
                    or sphagnum moss (genus <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi>), or to will-o'-the-wisps, the
                    mysterious lights over marshes and bogs which are said to mislead travelers. The
                    title suggests the sort of Irish drama Cather had seen in London, especially
                        <hi rend="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</hi>. Both plays are set in rural
                    Ireland; the character Hilda plays is named Peggy, and her prototype, Maire
                    O'Neill, played Pegeen Mike. There are other correspondences as well. Though
                    there are no donkeys in Synge's play, a mule race takes place offstage. Synge's
                    play is set in a public house, not a cabin, but both works are staged in a
                    single room. Finally, according to Synge's stage notes, his play opens with a
                    "turf fire" (i.e., a bog or peat fire) burning in the fireplace. <hi rend="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</hi> caused a stir when it was produced in Dublin
                    in January 1907, because its rough dialect and occasional sexual references were
                    thought to represent the Irish character in an unfavorable light. Its production
                    in London two years later must have been something of a memorial, however, for
                    Synge had died only a few months before, in March. </note>

               <p> Hilda Burgoyne: John P. Hinz observes in "The Real Alexander's
                    Bridge" that Ibsen's <hi rend="italic">The Master Builder</hi> was a likely influence
                    for Cather's novel and that Cather might have taken this character's name from
                    that play, for the aging master builder is, like Alexander, infatuated with a
                    woman named Hilda, who represents for him his lost youth.</p>
               <p>According to Edith Lewis, Cather modeled this figure after "a gifted young
                    actress in the cast [of <hi rend="italic">Playboy of the Western World</hi>] whose beauty and
                    engaging personality vividly impressed her" (68). That actress must have been
                    Maire O'Neill (1887&#8211;1952), whom Cather had seen play the role of
                    Pegeen Mike in Synge's rustic drama of Irish life in London, on 7 June 1909.
                    Maire O'Neill was born Molly Allgood, but her older sister, Sara Allgood, was
                    also an actress for the same theater company, so Molly took her mother's maiden
                    name. Synge had created the role of Pegeen Mike with Maire O'Neill in mind, and
                    it was common knowledge, though seldom publicized, that Synge and O'Neill were
                    engaged. One must suppose that O'Neill was still grieving Synge's death at the
                    time of this performance. Their romantic involvement was frowned upon by friends and family alike for a number of reasons: he was sixteen years older
                    than she; he was an atheist from a well-established family, while she was from
                    working-class parents who were ardently religious; and finally, W. B. Yeats and
                    Lady Gregory disapproved of the relationship because it was disruptive to the
                    purposes of the National Theatre. </p>
               <p>How much of this Cather would have known is uncertain, but she did attend the
                    production with Yeats and Lady Gregory and may have learned something of the, by
                    then, poignant details of Synge and O'Neill's relationship. At all events,
                    Cather would have been responsive to O'Neill's voice, which even Yeats praised:
                    "In dialect she is the one poetical actress our movement has produced"
                    (654&#8211;55). Hilda, Mainhall says, "has the Irish voice" (18). For more

               <p>"The Rising of the Moon": This popular Irish folk ballad
                    celebrates the bravery of Irishmen and their failed rebellion in 1798. It was
                    written by John Keegan Casey (1845&#8211;69), sometimes referred to as the
                    "Poet of the Fenians," while he was in prison, where he died at the age of
                    twenty-three. Since it is a call to arms, the song is not customarily sung by a
                    woman. The appropriateness of the song to Cather's theme may lie in the fact
                    that it tells of pikemen gathering at a river before battle. The death along
                    that unnamed river presages the deaths of workers at the Moorlock Bridge in
                    chapter 10. Lady Gregory took the title of the song for the title of her one-act
                    play (1907) about a fugitive and three policemen, which Cather saw with drama
                    critic William Archer (Woodress 207). It was performed in London in 1909 and in
                    New York when the Abbey Theatre performed there in November 1911. The fugitive
                    sings the ballad at the close of the play. Both Woodress (207) and Marilee
                    Lindemann (102 n. 17) mistakenly attribute the play to Synge, not Lady Gregory.</p>
               <p>Given the military character of the lyrics, it is unlikely that Cather meant to
                    suggest, as some have argued, the moon goddess, Diana. The song concludes:

            <note type="editorial" xml:id="en53" target="r53" n="53"> mummy room of the British Museum: The British Museum was
                    established in 1753; the present building in Bedford Square was built between
                    1823 and 1852. According to <hi rend="italic">A Guide to the Exhibition Galleries of the
                        British Museum</hi>, there were four Egyptian rooms on the upper
                    floor. The first and second rooms displayed several mummies. An 1847
                    newspaper illustration shows that the mummies were stacked above one another in
                    glass cases, unlike today; this may explain why Hilda thinks of the mummies as a
                    "forbidding pile." At the end of the first room is a representation of the
                    judgment scene from the Book of the Dead. It depicts a number of gods seated as
                    judges of the deceased, each of whose heart (conscience) is weighed in the
                    balance against a feather (symbol of law). It may be this painting that causes
                    Alexander to hurry from the room and to reassure himself that "the warm and
                    vital thing within him [his heart] was still there and had not been snatched away" (33). See illustration 15.</note>

                    of the sculptures of the Parthenon, which was still continually suffering wanton
                    mutilations, were removed to England by the Earl of Elgin, then British
                    Ambassador at Constantinople, with the consent of the Porte. The collection here
                    exhibited, and commonly known as the 'Elgin Marbles' (but also including some
                    additional pieces), was purchased from Lord Elgin by the British Government in
                    1816" (11). </p>
               <p>There may also be a residual suggestion here of Keats's "On Seeing the Elgin
                    Marbles" (1817), since Alexander's reaction to the British Museum as the
                    "ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things of the world were
                    assembled to make one's hour of youth the more precious" (32&#8211;33)
                    recalls Keats's reaction to the statuary: "My spirit is too
                    weak&#8212;mortality / Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, / And each imagin'd pinnacle and steep / Of godlike
                    hardship, tells me I must die / Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky" (ll.
                    1&#8211;5). The "undescribable feud" in Keats's heart (a mingling of
                    "Grecian grandeur" with the "rude / Wasting of old Time") likewise parallels the
                    feud in Alexander, in which a second self is "fighting for his life at the cost
                    of mine" (93). </p>

                    Gallery, and adjoining the Egyptian rooms is the Assyrian Saloon, which
                    displayed sculptures belonging to the reigns of three Assyrian kings. The
                    language is vaguely Shakespearean, however, and may recall Brutus's remark that
                    Calpurnia's "cheek is pale" and, a few lines later, Caesar's observation that
                    Cassius has a "lean and hungry look" (<hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi>, I.ii). Or perhaps

                    prototype for this bridge was the Quebec Bridge, meant to
                    span the St. Lawrence River. Soon after the collapse of the bridge in 1907,
                    construction began anew and a second, much shorter Quebec Bridge was completed
                    in 1917. Had the Quebec Bridge been completed without incident, it would have
                    been the longest cantilever bridge in existence, exceeding in length the
                    already-completed Forth Bridge in Scotland. The original design called for a
                    sixteen-hundred-foot main span, but Cooper recommended extending that span to
                    eighteen hundred feet, ninety feet longer than the Scottish bridge. The
                    significance of this change is twofold. First, there is at least the suggestion that Cooper's changes originated from hubris, that he
                    actively wished to build the longest cantilever bridge in existence. Second,
                    because the contract had already been drawn up before he recommended these
                    changes, the costs required modifications that contributed to the disaster.
                    Cooper himself said that the Quebec Bridge would be the "best and the cheapest."
                    Cather makes Alexander more sympathetic than Cooper by having him complain about
                    the cost limitations and by having him be modest about, even indifferent to, his
                    reputation. </note>

                    Probably a reference to John Singer Sargent's painting <hi rend="italic">The Luxembourg
                        Gardens at Twilight</hi> (1879; see illustration 16). Sargent
                    (1856&#8211;1925), an American painter known for his portraits of eminent or
                    socially prominent people, had studied art in Italy, France, and Germany and
                    received a formal art education at the &#201;cole des Beaux-Arts. </p>
               <p>Sargent was an expatriate who spent most of his adult life in England, visiting
                    America infrequently. He was sometimes criticized for an artificial brilliance.
                    Around 1907 Sargent tired of portrait painting and thereafter accepted few
                    commissions. He then worked chiefly on impressionistic European scenes
                    in watercolor. Sargent is probably instanced as someone who forfeited his genius
                    for a public reputation, as Alexander fears he has. However, since after 1907 he
                    returned to scenes of what might be described as "charming color and spirit,"
                    the allusion may indicate the successful return to the vitality of an earlier

                    there. Alexander feels the loss of his youth and sense of freedom and

                    he did not have authority to stop the work. In any case, his telegram was

                    government decided to build a new bridge at the same site and, instead of
                    issuing a charter, appointed a new board and took a more direct interest in its
                    construction. The bridge was completed in September 1917.</note>

                    "Commission." Perhaps Cather was thinking of the Royal Commission of Inquiry
                    appointed by the Canadian Parliament to investigate the disaster. </note>

                        (<hi rend="italic">Engineering Magazine: An Industrial Review</hi> Apr. 1908:
                    100&#8211;102). The disaster "might have been prevented by the exercise of
                    better judgment on the part of those in responsible charge of the work for the
                    Quebec Bridge and Railway Company." "No one connected with the general
                    designing," the report continues, "fully appreciated the magnitude of the work
                    nor the insufficiency of the data upon which they were depending" (101). Here as
                    elsewhere, Cather has modified the facts of the case and shifted the

                  <p>This eighth volume of the Cather Edition presents a critical text of Willa
                    Cather's first novel, <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, published in April 1912 by
                    Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. A magazine version of the novel,
                    titled <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Masquerade</hi>, was published in three installments in
                        <hi rend="italic">McClure's Magazine</hi> in February, March, and April 1912. The first
                    British edition, titled <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridges</hi>, was published in London by
                    Heinemann in August of the same year. A "new" Houghton Mifflin edition
                    appeared in 1922; this included a preface by Cather. The book was part of volume
                    3 of the Autograph Edition of Cather's fiction, which appeared in 1937. No other
                    edition in English was published during Cather's lifetime, nor have manuscripts,
                    proofs, or other materials antedating or contemporary with these texts been
                    located. </p>
                  <p>The editorial procedure of the Cather Edition is guided by the protocols of the
                    Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions. We begin with a
                    bibliographical survey of the history of the text, sorting out any problems it
                    may present. Making a calendar of extant texts, we collect and examine examples of all texts published during Cather's lifetime,
                    identifying those forms that may be authorial (i.e., that involved or may have
                    involved Cather's participation or intervention). These forms are collated
                    against a base text serving as a standard of collation.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr1" target="tcn1"/>The collations provide lists of substantive and accidental variations
                    among these forms.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr2" target="tcn2"/>A conflation, constructed from
                    the collations, then provides us with a list of variant readings in all relevant
                    (authoritative) editions. After an analysis of this conflation, we
                    choose a copy-text and prepare a critical text. The collations and their
                    conflation also provide the materials for an emendations list, which
                    identifies changes the editors have made in the setting copy, and for a list of
                    significant variants in authoritative editions that were not included in the
                    list of emendations. In a separate procedure, we make a list of end-hyphenated
                    compounds with their proper resolution.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr3" target="tcn3"/>

                  <p>This essay includes discussions of the composition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge
                   </hi> and of the production and printing history of the text during Cather's
                    lifetime, an analysis of the changes made in the text during this period, a
                    rationale for the choice of text for this edition, and a statement of the policy
                    under which emendations have been introduced. All page and line references are
                    to the text of the present edition, unless otherwise noted. </p>

                  <p>Cather apparently wrote most of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> during 1911; in that 
                    year she also had surgery for a mastoid infection, which required several weeks of recuperation;
                    spent approximately a month on <hi rend="italic">McClure's Magazine</hi> business in London and 
                    another week visiting Mrs. James T. Fields in Boston; and worked again at <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> 
                    for the three months preceding September 28. She then took a six-month leave from the magazine
                    and, with Isabelle McClung, rented a house for three months in Cherry Valley,
                    west of Schenectady, New York. Here she worked on revisions for the magazine
                    text of her novel, which one source reports she had sent to <hi rend="italic">McClure's
                    </hi> from St. Louis under the pseudonym "Miss Fanny Cadwallader."<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr4" target="tcn4"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cather customarily wrote the first drafts of her novels in longhand, then
                    prepared or had prepared one or more typescripts, revising each as she went
                    along.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr5" target="tcn5"/>Although no manuscripts or typescripts of
                    <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> are known to have survived, we have every reason
                    to believe that she followed this procedure with her first novel. Presumably,
                    one copy of the final typescript went to <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> for the magazine
                    edition, and Cather retained another copy, which she revised fairly extensively
                    before sending it (or a retyped copy of it) to Houghton Mifflin.
                    Ferris Greenslet wrote the reader's report, dated 21 November 1911, noting that
                    the manuscript "comes to us as the result of many solicitations" and remarking
                    on the "likeness" of the work to that of Edith Wharton. After summarizing the
                    plot, Greenslet says that the novel is remarkable for "the excellence of the
                    workmanship, its remarkable perceptiveness, its actuality, and the spiritual
                    sense of life that informs it." He expects a modest sale of three or four thousand copies, 
                    but adds that Cather will be "in every way a very desirable connection for us." 
                    The contract, dated 1 December 1911, provided for a 10 percent royalty on the first 3,000 
                    copies sold at trade-list retail, escalating to 15 percent on copies sold above 5,000.

                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">McClure's Magazine</hi> installments are of roughly equal length, the last
                    one only slightly shorter than the first two. Part 1 in the magazine (pp.
                    384&#8211;95) includes chapters 1&#8211;3 of the novel; part 2 (pp.
                    523&#8211;36) includes chapters 4&#8211;7; part 3 (pp. 659&#8211;68)
                    includes chapters 8&#8211;10 and the Epilogue. Illustrations by F. Graham
                    Cootes appear on pp. 384, 524&#8211;25, 527, and 658. They are full-page
                    except for the one on pp. 524&#8211;25, which is double-page. Quotations (in
                    caps) key them to the text as follows: </p>
                  <p>384: "Alexander switched on the lights and stood in the archway, glowing with
                    strength and cordiality" (10.5&#8211;7, altered). The illustration shows a
                    distinctly fortyish Alexander in an arched doorway, his tall wife to his left,
                    both looking at Lucius Wilson, who appears to be rising from his chair. A bowl
                    of roses on a table occupies the foreground. (Used on p. 11 of the first British
                    edition.) </p>
                  <p>524&#8211;25: "Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles
                    and broke into a low, happy laugh. 'How jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you
                    remember that first walk we took together in Paris?"' (52.8&#8211;11). The
                    center of the table divides the composition: Bartley on the right, looking at
                    Hilda animatedly; Hilda on the left, looking away from him with a much more
                    serious expression. (Used on p. 73 of the first British edition.) </p>
                  <p>527: " 'Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?"'
                    (56.18&#8211;19). This illustration accurately depicts the scene described
                    in the text. (Used as the frontispiece to the first British edition.) </p>
                  <p>658: " 'I thought I had to see you. That's all. Good-night; I'm going now.' She
                    turned and her hand closed on the doorknob" (97.7&#8211;9, slightly
                    altered). The illustration shows Hilda, hand on the knob of the door, looking
                    sad; Alexander has her arm, as if about to stop her. The effects of the wet
                    weather, prominent in the text, are not depicted. (Used on p. 139 of the first
                    British edition.) </p>
                  <p>The first edition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> in book form was published on 20
                    April 1912.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr7" target="tcn7"/>Crane reports that a preliminary dummy was
                    ordered on 19 December 1911, that the composition order was placed at the
                    Riverside Press on 28 December, and that printing was authorized 3 January 1912.
                    Complete proof was sent to Cather on 30 January 1912, and two copies of the
                    finished book were sent to secure British copyright on 25 March (23). This
                    information is confirmed by Houghton Mifflin estimate cards and
                    production records. </p>
                  <p>Crane records two issues of the first edition. In what she calls the "first
                    issue," the half title appears on p. i, p. ii is blank, the title page is p.
                    iii, and the copyright notice appears on p. iv. In the "second issue," the title
                    page is p. i, copyright information appears on p. ii, the half title is on p.
                    iii, and p. iv is blank. Crane argues that, although the rearrangement of the
                    preliminaries "may have occurred in the second pressrun from the standing
                    plates," the rarity of copies of the first issue "indicates that the change was made earlier in the first run, probably a
                    stop-press correction" (23).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr8" target="tcn8"/>Crane seems to conclude that
                    what she calls the first issue precedes the second because the Library of
                    Congress deposit copy has the normal arrangement of preliminaries and would
                    presumably have been an early copy, and because there are many more extant
                    copies of the book with the abnormal arrangement of preliminaries than with the
                    normal one. </p>
                  <p>However, it is difficult to understand why a printer would have ordered a
                    stop-press correction involving the reimposition of plates for no other reason
                    than to change the usual arrangement of preliminaries to an anomalous
                    one&#8212;the half title, by convention, precedes the title. Frederick B.
                    Adams suggests that the change might have been made for "esthetic" reasons, in
                    order to have a blank page facing the first page of text (103&#8211;04).
                    Adams had previously stated, basing his argument on the Library of Congress
                    deposit copy and on the paucity of copies of the book with the normal
                    arrangement of preliminaries, "that the correct order of preliminaries
                    represents a true first issue, and that the incorrect order is characteristic of
                    all later issues," adding that he could not say "by what freak of production so
                    extraordinary a situation could exist" (99). </p>
                  <p>We think it equally possible that Crane's "first issue" was the second (showing
                    the half title in its customary position preceding the title) and that what she
                    calls the "second issue" was the first (showing the half title following the
                    title). As Herbert Johnson notes, it was not uncommon for an imposition error to persist through most of the copies printed, and advance copies (and
                    presumably copyright copies) were always made up of the corrected
                    sheets.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr9" target="tcn9"/>We also believe it more accurate to label
                    Crane's two "issues" as states of a single issue.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr10" target="tcn10"/>In what follows we adopt that terminology. </p>
                  <p>Crane states that the book was "reissued by Houghton Mifflin in about
                    1918 using surplus sheets of the original printing," priority of issue
                    determinable only by differences in binding (22).<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr11" target="tcn11"/>
                    However, the production record card does not mention a reissue in 1918. If
                    no changes were made to the signatures used, it is at least possible that no
                    entry was made (though one would expect to see an entry to cover binding costs,
                    and there is none), but we can find no other evidence of a printing or issue c.
                    1918. At one point Crane states that "270 sets of the original sheets" were
                    offered to Heinemann, which eventually decided to reset the text for the British
                    edition (23). This cannot have been a c. 1918 reissue, however, because there
                    would have been no reason to offer Heinemann copies of the U.S. edition after
                    Heinemann had published its own (in 1912), unless one makes the unlikely
                    assumption that the original British edition had been exhausted and Heinemann
                    did not wish to reprint from its own plates. More likely, the new issue was the
                    "small edition" (i.e., printing or issue) "which will tide us over for a few
                    months" referred to by Ferris Greenslet, Cather's editor at Houghton
                    Mifflin, in his 4 May 1922 letter to her. It had been printed, he
                    said, while he was in Europe, which would date it between 23 January and 21
                    April 1922. The Houghton Mifflin production card has an entry "X/4" dated 1/22, involving
                    270 copies at $.215 per copy. "X" usually indicates a "correction" or "repair"
                    order, and changes involving new plates were made in the copies mentioned below.
                    The most likely assumption is that Houghton Mifflin made changes to
                    the plates and either reprinted 270 copies or altered, bound, and reissued 270
                    previously unbound sets of sheets of the first issue. The charge of $58.13 (c.
                    270 x $.215) was for those changes and possibly for
                        binding.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr12" target="tcn12"/>We think it more likely that this was
                    a new printing, and treat it as such. </p>
                  <p>We have seen two copies, and have a description of another copy, of the book
                    without date on title page, with conventionally arranged preliminaries, with
                    colophon but without advertising leaves, and with "low" corrected to "blow" at
                    55.10. A two-leaf fold is inserted in the last gathering, leading to a new
                    collational formula. These copies are bound in blue mesh cloth with gilt
                    stamping and lack the "S." in Cather's name on cover and spine. We believe they
                    are copies of the January 1922 printing. </p>
                  <p>Crane says that, in all, the first edition comprised 5,270 copies, that the first
                    impression was of 2,270 sheets (22, 23), and that there was a second printing of
                    3,000 sets of sheets (23). Crane might have based the 5,270 figure on
                    information provided her by Linda J. Rush, of Houghton Mifflin's
                    contracts department, in a letter dated 31 March 1977, which specifies "a total
                    printing of 5,270 copies." However, this number, as Herbert Johnson points out,
                    is merely the sum of copies entered on the production record card, and clearly 
                    refers to all copies of the book printed between 1912 and 1933. In a
                    letter dated 1 May 2001, Ms. Jane LeCompte, corporate communications manager for
                    Houghton Mifflin, reports from printing records "that the first
                    printing was 2500 copies in March 1912," that "a new edition of 1000 copies was
                    printed in 1922; 500 more were printed in 1925," and that "there was a re-issue,
                    with a printing of 1000, in 1933." Crane gives no date for the "second printing"
                    she lists; its size agrees with the figure obtained by subtracting 2,270 from
                    the 5,270 figure she gives for the size of the first edition. We conclude that
                    there was no second printing of 3,000 copies from standing
                        type.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr13" target="tcn13"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Houghton Mifflin called a second edition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge
                   </hi> was initiated in 1921. Greenslet wrote Cather on 27 October of that year: "I
                    think that conditions are coming to a point where we can afford to reprint, but
                    reprinting ought to be accompanied by some sort of reannouncement to restimulate
                    interest in it." He suggested appending a long, uncollected short story, a
                    proposal that came to nothing. He wrote again, on 21 April 1922, that the
                    "reissue" was tentatively scheduled for the fall list and asked Cather if she
                    would like to write a preface. She agreed, and sent the typescript to him in
                    September; he acknowledged receiving it on 25 September. On 30 October Greenslet
                    wrote to say that he was sending Cather two copies under separate cover; she
                    wrote him on 11 November that she still had not received them. The date of
                    publication entered on the Houghton Mifflin record card is 25 October
                    1922, and the "New ed." is listed in the "Index to Fall Announcements" in 
                    <hi rend="italic">Publishers' Weekly</hi> for 23 September 1922: 1020. 
                    Crane's date of January 1922 for publication is a slip (the preface
                    itself is dated September 1922); the January printing was presumably the second
                    printing of 270 sets of sheets discussed above. The "new edition" had three
                    printings: 1,000 copies on 25 October 1922, 500 in July 1925, and 1,000 in June
                    1933 (a Houghton Mifflin production record specifies the 1933 printing
                    as consisting of 1,000 copies and dates it 21 June 1933). The list of Cather
                    titles in the preliminaries of the 1922 printing ends with <hi rend="italic">One of Ours
                   </hi> (September 1922), in the 1925 printing with <hi rend="italic">A Lost Lady</hi> (1923), and
                    in the 1933 printing with <hi rend="italic">Obscure Destinies</hi> (1932). </p>
                  <p>Crane says that the text of the 1922 "edition" is "set from the original 1912
                    plates to which is added the new front matter" (25) and notes that the error at
                    55.10 ("low" for "blow") is corrected. If this text was indeed reset from a copy
                    of the first edition or from the plates of the first edition, the 1922 edition
                    is a true edition. If, however, the 1922 printing was made from the 1912 plates
                    with a preface added, it is bibliographically another printing of the first
                    edition; the addition of new preliminary materials does not in itself constitute
                    a new edition, since it does not affect the text of the novel. Careful
                    examination of several copies confirms that the 1922 "edition" text was printed
                    from plates of the 1912 edition, not reset; following a common practice,
                    Houghton Mifflin called the edition a "new" one because it added
                    Cather's preface (it also changed the front matter and omitted the four pages 
                    of advertisements at the end already deleted in the 1922 printing) and because a
                    new copyright was secured.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr14" target="tcn14"/>Copies of "new
                    edition" printings 2 and 3 bear no date on the title page but have "1912 and
                    1922" on the copyright page. As noted above, they may be distinguished by the
                    contents of the list of Cather novels included in the preliminary materials. </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> formed part of volume 3 of the Autograph Edition of
                    Cather's fiction, published in 1937. Scribner's had initiated the idea of a
                    subscription edition as early as 1932, but Houghton Mifflin would not
                    release the rights to the four early novels it had published (Lewis
                    180&#8211;81; Greenslet to Cather, 1 July 1933; Knopf memoirs). When
                    Houghton Mifflin took up the idea, Cather worked with Greenslet, her
                    former editor there, and after some negotiation the edition was agreed
                    to.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr15" target="tcn15"/>Cather wanted W. A. Dwiggins, who had
                    designed some of her Knopf novels, as the designer, and she wanted the same type
                    font that had been used in the Thistle Edition of Robert Louis Stevenson (Cather
                    to Greenslet, 18 December 1936). Greenslet demurred (21 December 1936), and
                    Bruce Rogers was engaged instead (Woodress 468). During 1936 Cather looked over
                    the titles to be included and made changes, the number varying with the
                    particular title. There are also blanket changes in the edition, due either to
                    Cather's intervention or, more likely, to Houghton Mifflin house style
                    or Rogers's design&#8212;changes Cather probably did not specify but to some
                    of which she may have assented. </p>
                  <p>In summary, we suggest a simplification of Crane's account, with distinguishing
                points:

                  <p>Houghton Mifflin published the
                    first book edition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> as soon as the third
                    installment appeared in <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi>, yet there are more than four hundred
                    variants between the two texts, over 40 percent of them substantive. We believe
                    that these substantive changes are authorial; they are not the sort of variants
                    that results from an editor's hand, and they are typical of the kind of changes
                    that Cather was to make over and over again in later novels. The variants usually affect a word or a
                    phrase. When they involve a sentence or two, the typical change rearranges
                    clauses or phrases, or adds to or deletes from the original version without
                    recasting whole paragraphs. Cather does not reorganize her material or alter her
                    conceptions of character or event; instead, she makes her diction more colorful
                    or precise, eliminates the unnecessary or the redundant, clarifies pronoun
                    reference, and improves the rhythm of a phrase or a sentence. Changes deleting
                    material in the <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> text outnumber more than two to one changes
                    amplifying such material. A substantial part of the Houghton Mifflin
                    text is set line for line with the magazine text. </p>

                  <p>One sees in the frequency of these variants that Cather's tendency to regard the
                    magazine versions of her novels as drafts that she would improve for the first
                    editions in book form, but which she would not in most cases revise extensively
                    thereafter, is evident in her very first novel. </p>
                  <p>Some 250 additional variants between these two texts involve accidentals. It is
                    far from clear that Cather initiated all such changes. However, because she read
                    the proofs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i text, we believe she acceded to its accidentals, at least tacitly. For
                    example, almost half the spelling variants change <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> "theater" to
                    "theatre" (Alexander attends the theatre in London, not in the United States),
                    some 70 percent of word-division variants change one-word contractions such as
                    "didn't" to two-word contractions ("did n't"), and more than half the
                    punctuation variants involve the addition or deletion of a comma (especially the
                    addition of a comma to introductory phrases). These changes are often matters of
                    house style, although it is possible that Cather made a blanket specification of
                    the changes she wanted. The fifty-odd typographical changes may also have been
                    made by the Houghton Mifflin copy editor. More than 80 percent of them
                    add or delete a paragraph indentation, usually the former. These variants might
                    have been authorial, but it is equally likely that they were not; for example, a
                    great many of them mark new speech with a new paragraph, a practice that is more
                    probably the result of house style than of a deliberate authorial request. </p>

                  <p> The first British edition of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> was printed by
                    J. Miles &amp; Company and published by Heinemann in August 1912. Presumably
                    set from a copy of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1, the text exhibits more than 250 variants from that of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i, some 40 of them substantive. As is usual, many of the differences adapt
                    U.S. style to British conventions: "apartment" is changed to "flat,"
                    "greens" to "holly and mistletoe" or "holly" or "evergreens," "street clothes" to "outdoor clothes," "daft" to "crazy" or "wild," and
                    "shades" to "blinds."<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr16" target="tcn16"/>Other changes seem
                    arbitrary: "elegant" to "graceful," "jolt" to "nuisance," "reliable" to
                    "trustworthy." In some cases the Heinemann reading seems simply fussy: "poured"
                    to "poured out," "wrote her" to "wrote to her," "converse" to "conversation,"
                    "offset by" to "compensated for by." </p>
                  <p>Of the more than two hundred accidental variants, some 70 percent are accounted
                    for by the change from "o" or "u" to "ou" in words such as "color" and
                    "mustache," by the omission or addition of a comma, and by the change from
                    two-word contractions to one-word contractions. "Every one" and similar
                    compounds are set as one word, "gayly" is spelled "gaily," and words like
                    "travel" have their final consonant doubled in past tense. </p>
                  <p>There is no external evidence that these variants were the result of Cather's
                    intervention. Most of the accidental variants can be explained as the result of
                    Heinemann's house style (especially the use of British spelling conventions),
                    and most of the substantive changes could have been the result of the desire to
                    clarify or "improve" readings that were thought inaccurate or unfamiliar to
                    British readers. Moreover, none of the substantive variants (except the
                    correction of "low" to "blow" at 55.10 and "sleeves" to "sleeve" at 77.23)
                    appears in the Autograph Edition text. For these reasons, the Cather Edition
                    does not consider the Heinemann edition authoritative, and its readings are
                    omitted from the Table of Rejected Substantives. </p>

                  <p>No external evidence shows that these changes are authorial, nor is the internal
                    evidence especially convincing. The first two Autograph Edition readings in the
                    table are awkward, the third and fifth are unnecessary, and the fourth may be an
                    error. "Sleeves" is an error in <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i that any copy editor should notice and
                    correct, and the two variants following are unnecessary changes. "Was stopped"
                    is grammatically parallel with "was driven" in its sentence, but this is the
                    sort of fussy "improvement" that Cather generally disdained. The last Autograph
                    Edition reading changes the meaning of the sentence, but the <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i reading is
                    not incorrect. Cather might have specified these revisions, but they are
                    insignificant in comparison with the changes she made to the magazine text for
                      <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i. </p>
                  <p>Although a marked copy of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1 was presumably setting copy for the Autograph Edition text,
                    the accidental variants between the two
                    texts number over three hundred. There is no external evidence that they are
                    authorial: although Cather might have requested some classes of them or have
                    agreed to the styling of the Autograph Edition, the evidence suggests that most
                    if not all of the variants are the result of Houghton Mifflin's house
                    style or of Bruce Rogers's design for the edition. For example, the use of
                    single quotation marks instead of double to mark speech is characteristic of the
                    edition as a whole, as is the following of British spelling: more than half the
                    variants add the "u" to words such as "color," and another quarter change "gray"
                    to "grey." Over 60 percent of word-division changes turn <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i's two-word
                    contractions into one-word forms ("are n't" to "aren't," e.g.), and two-thirds
                    of the variants in punctuation involve the addition or deletion of a comma. It
                    is most unlikely that Cather would mark hundreds of specific changes in
                    accidentals yet give only cursory attention to substantives. </p>

                  </head>
                  <p> The general policy of the Cather Edition is to
                    prefer the earliest edition of a text in book form to a later one, because the
                    first printing of the first book edition usually best represents Cather's
                    intention for her work at the time when it most fully engaged her imagination.
                    No decision is made, however, until collations are done and their
                    conflation analyzed; it is always possible that the existence of late
                    proofs or other materials could lead to a different choice. In the case of <hi rend="italic">
                    Alexander's Bridge</hi> there are only three possibilities: the magazine text,
                    that of the first book edition, and that of the Autograph Edition. After a study
                    of these texts, we have chosen to reprint a copy of the first trade printing of
                    the first edition of the novel in book form (Houghton Mifflin, 1912),
                    emended to correct three errors.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr17" target="tcn17"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>We believe that Cather followed what became her usual practice in producing her
                    first novel. That is, the <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> text was based on one typescript
                    (ts1) and <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i either on a revised copy or carbon of ts1 or, possibly, on a
                    retyped copy of this revision (ts2). Although it is likely that Cather made some
                    changes on the Houghton Mifflin galleys, the differences between the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> texts seem too substantial and numerous to have resulted entirely from
                    galley changes to identical setting copy. </p>
                  <p>Our experience with other Cather novels for which typescripts exist has convinced
                    us that <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> house style and copyediting practices would have
                    altered the accidentals of ts1, just as Houghton Mifflin's house style
                    and copyediting practices altered those of the lost revision of the typescript
                    which served as setting copy for <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i. That is, both <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i are, with
                    respect to accidentals and typographical variants, "social" texts&#8212;the
                    result in the first case of passive acquiescence in <hi rend="italic">McClure's
                   </hi> copyediting, and in the second case of at least tacit collaboration between
                    Cather and her publisher.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr18" target="tcn18"/>Neither text represents
                    accurately or completely the accidentals of the typescript on which it was
                    based. However, we believe that <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i comes closer to Cather's intention for her work than <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>, because Cather more actively participated in its
                    preparation and because it is more typical of her work. </p>
                  <p>Although the text in <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> was published first, the evidence cited
                    above, and confirmed by Cather's practice in other novels that first appeared in
                    magazine form, indicates that Cather regarded the magazine versions of her
                    fiction as essentially drafts to be polished. In the case of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's
                    Bridge</hi>, the sheer number of substantive and accidental variants between
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i clearly supports this view. Moreover, once a novel appeared in book
                    form, there are in most cases (<hi rend="italic">The Song of the Lark</hi> is the obvious
                    exception) comparatively few substantive variants in later texts. Finally,
                    external evidence suggests that Cather was interested in the magazine versions
                    of her work only as they provided income; she told Knopf on one occasion that
                    she reacted negatively to the very idea of such publication but recognized its
                    income potential and publicity value (Cather to Knopf, 22 November 1922). There
                    is little indication that she took pains with any of the magazine texts of her
                    fiction except for the <hi rend="italic">Forum</hi> text of <hi rend="italic">Death Comes for the
                    Archbishop</hi>, of which corrected proof sheets exist for some chapters of
                    book 1. On the other hand, there is ample evidence that she took great pains
                    with the book versions. Edith Lewis, for example, notes that Cather "did not
                    much like serial publication" (180) but insisted on seeing foundry proofs of her
                    novels and asked Lewis herself to look at those proofs for <hi rend="italic">Shadows on the
                        Rock</hi> in her absence (161). We also know that Cather read proof for
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i, but it is unlikely that she did so for <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>. </p>
                  <p>There are good reasons to prefer the <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i text in selecting both substantive and
                    accidental variants&#8212;the substantives because they are clearly later,
                    authorial readings representing Cather's final intention for her novel, the
                    accidentals because the readings of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i not only received Cather's attention
                    but better represent her usual practice in other novels, for example, in such
                    frequent cases as the substitution of a comma plus dash for <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> comma, or the
                    British spelling of "theatre" and "grey." The "theatre" reading is particularly
                    interesting, because Houghton Mifflin's use of the British spelling
                    reflects the international flavor of the book and Cather's
                    sensitivity to cultural nuance. </p>
                  <p>Because <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i, alone of the authorial texts, is superior with respect to
                    substantives and follows Cather's known practice with respect to accidentals
                    better than <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>, we retain here a limited concept of copy-text. We have in the
                        case of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> an example of "radiating" texts: <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>.i
                    derive independently from a lost original. The earliest forms of the text
                    (holograph versions and early typescripts) are lost. A late typescript, also
                    lost, was copyedited at <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> and used as setting copy for <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>.
                    Meanwhile, Cather continued to revise, quickly producing a later text that was
                    used as setting copy for <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr19" target="tcn19"/>The readings of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi> are those of a magazine text Cather regarded merely as a source of additional
                    income&#8212;little more than a draft to be further revised. The substantive
                    readings of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM1</hi>.i are later, authorial, and superior. Its accidental readings
                    result from at least tacit collaboration between Cather and her copy editor (or publisher). 
                    We know that Cather read proof prior to publication, and in this case
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i accidentals are far more characteristic of Cather's practice in later
                    novels than are the readings of <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>. Thus, unless we find a nonsensical reading,
                    some sort of error, or other evidence, there is no reason not to prefer the
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i readings over those of <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>. In dealing with other Cather novels we have
                    made many more emendations than is the case here; in editing <hi rend="italic">One of Ours</hi>,
                    for example, we emend dozens of accidentals as well as nearly twenty
                    substantives. The resulting text of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> is essentially an
                        emended edition of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i. It is a critical text in the sense that it was arrived
                        at as the result of a series of editorial choices based on our belief that <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i
                    derives from revisions to a lost typescript closer to Cather's intentions for
                    her work than the "draft" version that served as setting copy for <hi rend="smallcaps">MM</hi>. </p>
                  <p>In the case of the Autograph Edition text of <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, there are
                    even fewer substantive variants than is the case for most other novels included
                    in that edition. This suggests that Cather's attention to this novel was
                    perfunctory. Most of the accidental variants, we believe, are the result of
                    house or edition styling; it is possible that Cather made some of these changes
                    or acceded to blanket changes, but there is no direct external evidence that she
                    did so, and the internal evidence is unconvincing. </p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Autograph Edition had a context quite different from that of <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.
                    It aimed to present the work of a well-established author to libraries and
                    collectors, and it came twenty-five years after the first book edition, which
                    had presented the reading public with a first novel by a relatively new author.
                    Cather's engagement with her work in 1912, especially given her later
                    disparaging remarks about <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi>, was obviously fuller; it
                    is not surprising that she gave the Autograph Edition text so little attention. </p>

                  <p>The Cather Edition emends setting copy under the following 
                        circumstances: (1) to correct a typographical error; (2) to
                    change an accidental when it is clear from many other examples that a particular
                    reading is anomalous&#8212;a slip or a rare exception; (3) to resolve
                    inconsistencies in accidentals occurring in such close proximity as to distract
                    a reader, provided that the prevailing practice of the text can be determined;
                    (4) to correct a misspelling or supply the proper accent on a word in a foreign
                    language; (5) to correct a substantive error or make a substantive change that
                    Cather herself asked to have corrected or which can be reasonably inferred to be
                    a change she requested; and (6) to correct a substantive error when it is clear
                    from many other examples that a particular reading is a slip or a rare
                    exception.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr20" target="tcn20"/>We do not emend to "improve" Cather's
                    wording or grammar, to modernize her diction or usage or use of accidentals, to
                    impose consistency where inconsistency is not obtrusive, to incorporate
                    authorial revisions that do not belong to the period of Cather's fullest
                    imaginative engagement with the work, or to correct errors that Cather herself
                    did not address (except when a simple factual error can be corrected without
                    further revising the text). </p>
                  <p>Houghton Mifflin set <hi rend="italic">Alexander's Bridge</hi> with some care. There
                    are few compositorial errors in <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i, and little of the inconsistency in the
                    treatment of accidentals that is obvious in, for example, <hi rend="italic">One of Ours</hi>. We
                    emend "low" to "blow" at 55.10, "Mrs" to "Mrs." at 57.2, and "sleeves" to
                    "sleeve" at 77.23, but we leave "good-by" at 98.5 as an acceptable form even
                    though it is changed to "good-bye" in the Autograph Edition text. Although the
                    Autograph Edition's "Hortons"' at 119.1 has merit, we leave "Horton's" because
                    it also makes good sense. We make one class of typographical changes silently,
                    setting in roman type all italicized punctuation marks that follow italicized
                    phrases whenever that punctuation belongs to the whole sentence instead of the
                    phrase in italic. For example, "that this should have happened to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>" is silently
                    changed to "that this should have happened to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!" (89.3&#8211;4). </p>
                  <p>We do not admit the variant substantive readings of the Autograph Edition. We
                    know that Cather did an unspecified amount of work on the text of the novel for
                    the edition, and she may well have indicated specific changes she wanted or have
                    agreed with Houghton Mifflin on blanket procedures for some
                    accidentals and even some substantives (e.g., the change from two-word
                    contractions like "did n't" to one-word contractions ("didn't"). In a letter to
                    Norman Holmes Pearson dated 23 October 1937, for example, Cather notes that she
                    made changes involving wording and punctuation even in the case of <hi rend="italic">Death
                    Comes for the Archbishop</hi>, where the changes were not extensive, but that
                    she read proof and revised proof of the Autograph text only when there were
                    extensive changes. The substantive changes in the Autograph Edition text might
                    have been authorial, but we believe that, taken together with the other features
                    of this text and considering that it comes a quarter century after the first
                    book edition of the novel, the differences reflect a different
                    intention for the collected edition text, especially in evincing a more formal
                    style. We are committed to providing readers with the most fully realized text
                    belonging to the period of Cather's most complete imaginative engagement with
                    her work, not with what might be in our opinion the "best" text of that work.
                    When Cather made the revisions for the Autograph Edition, she and her publisher
                    wanted a new and collected edition that would confirm her status as a major author, and Cather might
                    have made a few changes with that new intention in mind. We have no external
                    evidence of the particular changes she made, but we do not believe those changes
                    should take precedence over the readings of the first book edition. </p>
                  <p>Some readers may be uncomfortable with this approach; they will argue that the
                    relatively few substantive changes perfect the intention realized in <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i
                    rather than contribute to what we have considered a new intention in the
                    Autograph Edition. Such readers may prefer the readings of the Autograph Edition
                    found in the Table of Rejected Substantives, which lists all substantive and
                    quasi-substantive variants, other than those accepted as emendations, between
                    our text, the <hi rend="italic">McClure's</hi> magazine text, and the text of the Autograph
                    Edition. Because we do not consider variants from the Heinemann edition to be
                    authorial, they are not included. </p>
                  <p>Records of Cather's direct involvement in the design and production of her works
                    have led the Cather Edition to take special care in the presentation of them. We
                    are particularly concerned with compositor error. By agreement with the
                    University of Nebraska Press, we undertake proofreading in stages to meet the
                    Committee on Scholarly Editions guidelines, which call for at least four
                    readings.<ref type="editorial" xml:id="tcr21" target="tcn21"/> Insofar as is feasible within the
                    series format of a scholarly edition, the editors have cooperated with the
                    designer to create a volume that reflects Cather's known wishes for
                    the presentation of her works. </p>

                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="tcn2" target="tcr2" n="2">The Cather Edition (ce) follows the usual distinction: substantive
                        variants are changes in wording (including morphemic variations); accidental
                        variants include changes in spelling, case, punctuation, and word division.
                        Typographical changes (in paragraphing, font, spacing, etc.) are neither
                        substantive nor accidental, although they may be discussed; they represent
                        part of what Jerome McGann calls "bibliographical" as opposed to
                        "linguistic" codes. The basis of the distinctions here is the extent to
                        which a class of differences affects the meaning of the text: typography and
                        accidentals often do not, substantives do. ce also recognizes a class of

                     <p> Professor Johnson has provided a likely scenario for the presence of two
                    states of the first printing (letter to F. M. Link, 23 May 2002):
                <q rend="block">
                           <p>The original book was specified by the production manager to print as three
                    64-page printing forms yielding 192 pages overall, but with eight pages of the
                    last signature to be canceled (blank pages to be thrown away). This would reduce
                    the overall number of pages to 184. </p>
                           <p>The original pagination was intended to be: i&#8211;first half title;
                    ii&#8211;blank; iii&#8211;title page; iv&#8211;copyright;
                    v&#8211;second half title; vi&#8211;blank;

                    [177&#8211;178]&#8211;blanks = 184 pp. overall. </p>
                           <p>Then someone got the bright idea to add <hi rend="italic">four pages of ads</hi> at the end, only
                    they didn't make it clear to the pressman that the eight-page cancel was
                    superseded and the overall number of pages for the book was increased to 192. </p>
                           <p>The hapless pressman thought he had to get the four pages of ads into the 184 pp.
                    overall, but he was still two blank pages short. He had two alternatives: remove
                    pages i and ii or remove pages v and vi. He decided to remove pp. i and ii. </p>

                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="tcn10" target="tcr10" n="10"> In this we follow Philip Gaskell, who defines an "issue" as "all
                    the copies of that part of an edition which is identifiable as a 
                    consciously planned printed unit," whether "removed from the original issue
                    either in form (separate issue) or time (reissue)" (315); "state" refers to
                    those copies of a given issue or printing showing other variants, such as
                    stop-press correction, errors of imposition, etc. (316). It is unlikely that
                    Houghton Mifflin intended the copies with the half title preceding the
                    title to constitute either a separate issue or a reissue; from the paucity of
                    such copies, it is likely that a mistake in imposition was corrected late in the
                    press run, creating a second state of the first printing belonging to Gaskell's
                    class 4: "Errors of imposition, or of machining" (316). </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="tcn11" target="tcr11" n="11">Crane refers to a jacket "associated with copies after 1918" (22). This
                        jacket can be dated more precisely to the fourth printing of the edition
                        ("new edition," second printing): most of the titles listed on the back
                        cover date to 1925. </note>
                  <note type="editorial" xml:id="tcn12" target="tcr12" n="12">Professor Johnson notes that an "X" order would normally refer to
                        correction and repair (makeup) charges, whereas an "R" order would normally
                        indicate a new printing. As he also notes, however, an "X" order can refer
                        to both: to a new printing indeed, but one that involves significant
                        alterations. An example of this sort of entry is the "X/510 pr.1000 jkts" on
                        the existing production record card, which refers to a new printing of
                        jackets, to the plates of which significant changes were made. There are
                        thus two possibilities: (a) the charge for these 270 copies represents the
                        costs of a new printing which entailed significant changes to the existing
                        plates; or (b) the charge was for correction and other makeup charges (and
                        possibly binding charges) of remaining copies of the original printing. If
                        (a), the 270 copies comprise a second printing of the book; if (b), they
                        comprise a reissue. The first possibility is supported by the 5,270 total given by Linda Rush, by Greenslet's use of the word "edition" rather
                    than "issue," by the fact that the number "270" appears in the "what was
                    ordered" column on the production record card and the other four entries are
                    definitely for printings, by the fact that the numbers in that column total
                    5,270, and by the fact that the first and last signatures had to have been
                    reprinted. The second possibility is supported by Ms. LeCompte's total of 5,000
                    copies, by the order number "X/4" rather than "R/4," and by the charge of $.215
                    per copy (this seems too little to cover changes to the plates and the cost of
                    paper, printing, and binding, unless only two new signatures were reprinted). </note>

                        1918, his figure would have been much higher. </note>

                        line, under "with" in eight copies; a smudge to the right of the page number

                        a smudge on <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi> p. 126, line 19, over the "a" in most copies. These
                        imperfections appear in copies of 1912, c. 1918, and 1922&#8211;33
                        printings. The usual practice in the text is to set "Mrs." with a period,
                        but the period is omitted at 57.2 in all texts of the first edition. Certain
                        type breaks occur in some copies of printings after 1912 (the comma after
                        "Walford's" at <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi> 52.16 and the second "e" of "see" at <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi> 58.9) but not in
                        copies of the 1912 printing. Since publishers were not always
                        bibliographically precise in their use of terms, one ought not make too much of Greenslet's
                    references to "reprint" and "re-issue" in his letters to Cather, but they are
                    suggestive, as is Houghton Mifflin's 1937 statement defining a "new
                    edition" as "a revision on which new copyright is taken" (Zempel and Verkler
                    128). Since the novel was by no means a best-seller, there is also the cost of a
                    completely reset edition to consider&#8212;the cost recorded on the
                    production record ($99.52) is insufficient to cover the cost of a full set of
                    new plates. </note>

                    studies of the format for your collected works, we would like to begin with
                    Volume I, which will probably contain <hi rend="smallcaps">alexander's bridge</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">o pioneers!</hi> I am

                    into the Autograph text; Greenslet may be thinking of the preface that Cather
                    provided for the October 1922 "new edition." </note>

                        possibility of establishing a single satisfactory text. T. H. Howard-Hill
                        has put the matter succinctly: the "insistence that a scholarly editor is
                        not a 'rescuer and restorer' of texts and that editors 'have been caught out
                        trying to promote the purity of texts' leaves the matter of emendation in
                        doubt. . . . [I]f merely accidental collocations of words will satisfy
                        critics, then editing is essentially unnecessary. Literary theories that
                        emphasize the ambiguity, multivalency, and plurisignification of textual
                        utterances recommend a form of edition in which these textual properties are
                    appropriately acknowledged. Nevertheless, it seems that it would be important
                    for critics who value these textual properties to know the source and (probably)
                    the authority of the specific utterances on which critical attention is to be
                    focused. Only the kind of textual criticism that results in the 'establishment'
                    of a text can furnish this information. It may be polemically advantageous for
                    advocates of new forms of editing to denigrate and dismiss the fundamental
                    functions of textual criticism, but ultimately it is irrational" (52). </note>

                    chronological sequence, the variant readings and the abbreviations for their

                    omission made for the sake of brevity; they are not part of the Cather Edition
                    text unless so indicated. If no reference is given, that text agrees with <hi rend="smallcaps">HM</hi>1.i.
                    We have used the paragraph symbol without brackets to indicate variants in
                    paragraphing; although typographical rather than substantive, such breaks
                    sometimes have an effect on meaning. </p>
