            <hi rend="italic">The focus acknowledges the topicality and continued relevance
                     of violence to discussions of literature and culture. How does an
                     author "write" violence? Is the representation of violence
                     fundamental to our experiences of art, as a commentator such as
                     Girard has suggested? Is there something "new" in the
                     twentieth-century's experience of violence? And can we identify
                     specifically American encounters with violence--in terms of
                     representation, mythologies, and narratives? And what does it mean
                     to write about violence as a female author?</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Cather has always been implicated and engaged with these
                     debates, ever since Hemingway castigated her portrayal of the Great
                     War battlefields. We enourage participants to think widely and
                     laterally about the topic, however, and to think about the myriad
                     forms in which Cather explores (and sometimes fails to explore)
                     violence and its effects. Violence can be deployed in metaphorical
                     and suggestive ways, as well as taking us back to Cather's war
                     novel. Participants might well want to address the violence of
                     dispossession, the violence implicit in acts of discovery and
                     collecting, or the emotional violence of neglect or
                     misrecognition.</hi>
