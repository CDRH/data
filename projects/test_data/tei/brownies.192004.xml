                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">T</hi>HERE were five of us little comrades, and we
                        lived in neighboring houses on the very last slope of the great green hill,
                        at whose foot towers Toulon, the city of war.</p>
                    <p>The windows of our houses looked out beyond the red roofs of the city, upon
                        the road; and beyond the road upon the green hills of Saint-Mandrier; and
                        beyond the hills, upon the vast, deep blue sea, which is forever changing,
                        and which yet, remains forever the same.</p>

                    <p>As we were all pupils in the nearby school, we were scarcely ever separated
                        from each other. Leon, the largest of us all, was twelve years old, Paul,
                        the smallest, was eight. Leon never moved without his drum, a real drum,
                        which we followed everywhere with a soldierly bearing. Petey, who was ten,
                        always carried a flag; Frederick and Stevie marched along next, armed with
                        wooden swords; and Paul always came last, never carrying anything except,
                        indeed, his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>His thoughts, goodness knows, were weighty enough, for every day little Paul
                        kept discovering something new in the great world, and,
                        furthermore,&#8212; make what you please out of this,&#8212;little
                        Paul was in love!</p>
                    <p>He was in love,&#8212; yes, really he was,&#8212;with Stevie's big
                        sister. Stevie was something of a silly, the simpleton of the group. Why,
                        you could make him believe all sorts of things! Just imagine,&#8212;that
                        idiot believed that "Little Red Riding-Hood" was a story which had actually
                        happened! As though you could be nine years old, and still believe such a
                        thing as that!</p>
                    <p>Stevie's sister was named Elise, but we used to call her Lieze. She was
                        nearly fifteen years old, and that was what charmed us. She never played
                        with us, and that idealized her in our eyes. She used to come twice a day,
                        at mealtime, to call her brother from the ravine where we used to be
                        wandering; from the depths of the jungles of rosemary, where we used to
                        pretend we were lost; or from among the rocks, where we would be searching
                        for the cave of Ali-Baba.</p>
                    <p>From way far off, the noise of Leon's drum guided her. She would come
                        running, calling in her pretty voice:</p>
                    <p>"Stevie! Ste-vie-ee!"</p>
                    <p>Then, sh! silence! the drum became mute, and we would slip unseen, into the
                        densest of the thickets. We would lie down in the thyme, which smelt so good
                        when you crushed it. And when her voice came to us again from the
                        distance:</p>
                    <p>"Stev-vie-ee!"</p>
                    <p>Then, "rat-tat-tat"! and the drum would seem to say: "Oh, what a silly girl,
                        not to be able to tell where we are!"</p>
                    <p>The flag would be hoisted at arm's length, above the tops of the rosemary;
                        and when the seeker finally arrived, all of us together would rush upon her,
                        clinging to her dress, her arms, her neck. And Paul, being the smallest, always

                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">On</hi> Good Friday, of that particular year, Stevie
                        did not come to play, and Leon had to leave his drum at home. "This is what
                        Mama told me," he declared: "The bells have gone away, so you can't have
                        your drum till tomorrow."</p>
                    <p>This mentioning of drums and bells together, gave us a great deal to think of,
                        and we stopped talking of anything else.</p>
                    <p>All the church-bells in France had set out for Rome. No one would hear them
                        ring again until the next day at noon. They would start back in the morning,
                        for the journey was a long one; but how would they come back? Guess how!
                        Across the great avenue of the heavens! They would have wings for that
                        special purpose. Could they be seen? Perhaps, if they didn't take it into
                        their heads to fly too far up in the sky, out of sight, or to pass by too
                        far away, out there, above the open sea.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, pshaw! fellows," said Leon sturdily, "all that sort of thing is just
                        like a fairy-tale, just like 'Little Red Riding-Hood.' It doesn't really
                        happen."</p>
                    <p>We were all of us a little suspicious, and all our little group began to
                        think about it with an air of great mental fatigue. All of us, even Leon,
                        seemed disappointed and distressed. I shall never forget Leon's unhappy and
                        discontented manner while he was enlightening us. It was plain that he
                        missed something. It was, I imagine, his drum.</p>
                    <p>"The church-bells," he continued, stretching out his arm and holding his
                        forefinger rigid, "are right up there in the belfries. Only they're not
                        ringing. And someone comes along and tells us that they have gone to Rome!
                        Papa said to me:</p>
                    <p>"'No one, but a fool, would believe that.'</p>
                    <p>"Besides, didn't Mama say: 'You are wrong; little folks don't need to be told
                        the truth about everything so soon'?</p>
                    <p>"That's when she took my drum from me. <hi rend="ornamental">It</hi> hasn't
                        gone to Rome; neither have the bells. That's all there is to it."</p>
                    <p>We were convinced, none too willingly, and somewhat saddened at learning the
                        truth. In order to shake off this feeling of gloom that 
                        <pb facs="brownies.192004.007.jpg"/>
                        <fw>101</fw><fw>THE BROWNIES BOOK</fw> had settled over us, we had to invent
                        some game. With each one saying a word in his turn, then with all of us
                        talking at the same time, here is the idea upon which we finally
                        decided.</p>
                    <p>Since we were all so wise, we would make sport of the ignorance and
                        simplicity of Stevie. We would take him, the next morning, to the very top
                        of the hill, and we would pretend to see the church-bells pass by in the
                        sky. He, of course, wouldn't see them, because they were all really in the
                        church-towers; and that would be awfully funny. It looked as though our
                        Easter vacation were going to be well employed.</p>
                    <p>Leon promised to go and get Stevie the next morning, and we separated full of
                        plans, thinking how funny our little comrade would look on the top of the
                        steep hill. Only one thing made us still a bit sad, and that was that Lieze
                        hadn't come to call us for the last two days. That, of course, happened
                        sometimes, and it was very natural today, since Stevie, probably, because it
                        was Good Friday, had remained in the house along with his drum.</p>
                    <milestone unit="III"/>
                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">THE</hi> next day we went up the hill. All five of us
                        took the military road. Leon had his drum, but his drum-sticks were quiet on
                        his chest, fastened to his shoulder-belt. His mother had forbidden him to
                        use them, until the church-bells came back. Peter had his flag rolled up
                        around the flagstaff, trailing a bit on the ground. Breathlessly, we rushed
                        on, trying to keep up with big Leon, and every once in a while, when the
                        slope became too steep, our little hands would have to seek a resting-place
                        on our little knees.</p>
                    <p>"Halt!" said Leon, when we were half-way up.</p>
                    <p>We sat down and began to talk, glad to take a little rest, and pleased with
                        the thought of having a chance to make fun of Stevie's stupidity.</p>
                    <p>"Isn't Lieze coming to look for us today?" spoke up Paul suddenly.</p>
                    <p>Stevie's answer threw us all into the deepest grief. No, Lieze would not come
                        to call us, because she was very, very ill. She had been in bed for three
                        days.</p>
                    <p>"The doctor said this morning that, perhaps, she was going to die," Stevie
                        continued gravely. "Mama let me come out because the house must be kept
                        perfectly quiet, on account of Lieze. And I was very glad to come, because
                        somebody told me this once,---if, when you see the church-bells flying by
                        in the sky, you make a wish right away, the good Lord will grant you whatever
                        you ask. So, you see, I've just got to see the church-bells for Lieze's 
                        sake."</p>
                    <p>There was a long silence.</p>
                    <p>"That's the way it is with falling stars," said little Peter finally.</p>
                    <p>And Frederick continued: "if you ask the good Lord for something before the
                        star dies out, He'll see that you get it."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, that's the way I heard it, too," said Stevie. And he repeated, "I've
                        just got to see the church-bells!"</p>
                    <p>"You or I, or any of us," said Paul. "It doesn't make any difference. It's all
                        the same thing as far as Lieze is concerned."</p>
                    <p>Paul was right; we would all make the same wish.</p>
                    <p>Again there was a long silence. Some strange unknown feeling was disturbing
                        our little hearts. It was a feeling of sadness, of sweetness, and of
                        mystery. It was our love for Lieze. We wanted to see her again, to see her
                        pretty and lively self, many, many times; to hear her call us again, among the
                        echoes of the mountain; to hug her again; to lose her and find her once more
                        in our immense thickets of rosemary, towering about our heads!"</p>
                    <p>What notion did we have of what it would mean if Lieze should die? We only
                        knew that we should never see her again. We could not stand that. And yet,
                        how could we be sure that she was not going to die? Ah! if that story about
                        the bells could only be true! If one of us could just catch sight of them
                        way up there, flitting across the little clouds in the sky like swallows or
                        sea-gulls! And, after all, why not? Our fathers did not believe, it is true,
                        that the bells went off traveling along with the birds; but our mothers had
                        told us so. Why shouldn't they be the ones who were right? We needed
                        consolation so badly!</p>
                    <p>All these thoughts struggled for expression in our minds, one on top of the
                        other, unformed and pitiful, confused by the very desire which so touchingly
                        gave them birth. We loved her so much, our grown-up Elise! For her sweet
                        sake, we realized that we were very unfortunate not to be able to believe in
                        the flying bells. ... But, perhaps, they did fly after all! Why not?...Not
                        all, perhaps, but just a few...Those of Toulon, of course, were in the
                        church-towers; but those of Paris,&#8212;who

                        <fw>102</fw><fw>THE BROWNIES BOOK</fw> knew where they were?...Anyway, none
                        of us thought any longer of making fun of poor Stevie. We didn't even think
                        of playing. We only wanted to know that Lieze would not die.</p>
                    <milestone unit="IV"/>
                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">NOW</hi> we had arrived on the bare and stony summit of
                        the hill. We placed the drum and flag on the ground, and looked around us.
                        The country-side, the hills, and the plains, and especially the sea and sky,
                        seen from way up there, seemed so vast that we were a little afraid.</p>
                    <p>But there were five of us, well-armed; and when, lowering our eyes, we
                        perceived at the foot of the hill, the reassuring roofs of our houses, and
                        recognized our gardens, and even the people walking around in them, we felt
                        somewhat more confident.</p>
                    <p>"There, I think that's Papa! Yes, I'm sure of it! And see there's
                        Grandma!"</p>
                    <p>Alas! In Stevies's garden, there wasn't any-body! The windows of Lieze's room
                        weren't even open, on this beautiful morning in Holy Week. And then, with
                        one accord, all of us stopped looking at the house, and looked up at the
                        sky, in the hope of finding there some means of help.</p>
                    <p>Those who have never tried, while children, to gaze thus for a whole hour
                        into the infinite depth of a sky strewn with tiny clouds, in order to see a
                        winged form pass by bringing the promise of happiness, will never know how
                        vast the blue desert is, and how many winged atoms fly there, streaking it
                        incessantly with unexpected zigzags and fanciful shadows!</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, the clouds hid the sun from us every now and then. Just the
                        same, our eyes hurt us from looking at the dazzling light so long. And when
                        we lowered our gaze to the ground again, we couldn't understand why we saw
                        so many queer shadows about us.</p>
                    <p>Every moment our hearts leaped up with hope. Now it was a fly which, passing
                        within our reach, gave the effect of a bell flying far, far away in the
                        depths of the sky, almost lost to sight way out there above the sea; now it
                        was a roof sparrow, tranquilly busy with its own affairs. Often the
                        sea-gulls deceived us, dim, indistinct figures, flying way, way out in the
                        direction of the Hyeres Islands, near a certain rock where they make
                        their nest. In the air floated many nameless things; bits of wool torn from
                        sheep by the spurs of the thorny broom-plant, and then scattered again to
                        the passing wind; all sorts of airy nothings; threads from the plant called
                        Virgin; shreds of feathers; indescribable odds and ends, which, escaping the
                        hands of working-men, flitted on a wayward breeze across the sky line like
                        tiny beings, followed now and then by a too easily misled bird.</p>
                    <p>We looked toward the east, towards Rome and Jerusalem. The swallows, we knew,
                        came from that direction, and also the martens and carrier-pigeons, and all
                        the other migratory creatures in whom the April season awakens a desire for
                        something different. And in us, too, arose the desire to fly, to roam; a
                        yearning for wide open spaces; a vision of soaring. Something fluttered
                        within us, like a captive, useless wing. And it was love. It was devotion and
                        tenderness. Just as these emotions are in the hearst of man, so they were
                        already in us, alive and imperishable!</p>
                    <milestone unit="V"/>
                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">"THERE</hi> is one; I see it!"</p>
                    <p>Little Paul had seen a flying church-bell! Yes, with the eyes of his desire,
                        with the eyes of his love, he had seen it.</p>
                    <p>"Are you quite, quite sure?" cried Stevie, turning a little bit pale.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
                    <p>He hadn't really seen it, of course not! But he thought that because he <hi
                            rend="italics">thought</hi> he had seen one, he could say: "I <hi
                            rend="italics">did</hi> see one."</p>
                    <p>Who can explain the origin of this tender childish lie? It was to himself
                        that he lied first, in the hope of deceiving Stevie: not, indeed, to make
                        fun of him, but, quite to the contrary, to console him. And why not admit
                        it? He hoped, too, that he would be able to deceive the good
                        Lord,&#8212;just a little...Oh! the unspeakable tenderness!</p>
                    <p>All our eyes, stretched wide, sought in the sky for the tiny speck, the
                        slight, elusive, dark spot which Paul had indicated with his finger.</p>
                    <p>Leon, the unbeliever, was the first to catch sight of it again: "There,
                        there, yes, I see it, I see it! Over there!"</p>
                    <p>What more need I say? One after the other, or rather one with the other, all
                        of us saw the bell soaring on its great wings, which was to bring health
                        back to Lieze. And the good Lord, who is kind to children, pretended to
                        believe us. It is evident that He smiled upon us, for Lieze came back a few
                        days later and called us again in her pretty voice, among the echoes of the
                        mountain.</p>

                    <head>THE BIRDS AT MY DOOR</head>
                    <byline>MARY EFFIE LEE</byline>
                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">IF</hi> you live in the country, you can have many
                        interesting experiences with birds. One morning, at about seven o'clock,
                        last March, I discovered a fawn-colored screech owl perched disconsolately
                        upon the upper sash of a window which had been left lowered from the top all
                        night. The owl, uttering faint croons, peered about as if trying to discover
                        where he had spent the night. It was many minutes after my finding him, that
                        he fluttered heavily away. My first cry of surprise seemed in no wise to
                        have disturbed him.</p>
                    <p>Once, at this same window, I found a chimney swift, clinging desperately to
                        the screen. The bird had flown in at the top of the window and landed just
                        inside, against the screen below. He was quivering with fear.</p>
                    <p>For countless springs, the swifts, or swallows, had taken up their abode in a
                        south chimney of our house. We could hear them often at night, in the
                        brick-walled home. They seemed always to be "cuddling down", yet never to
                        get quite "cuddled" to their satisfaction. The little bell-like twitterings
                        would be sounding, I imagined, whenever I awoke.</p>
                    <p>At dusk, when the sky was lavender, the swallows would flutter in graceful
                        groups, trilling, swirling high over our heads. How well I can see them
                        now!&#8212;grouping themselves, breaking ranks, then flitting together.
                        But as to having come into close contact with our neighbors, the swifts,
                        that pleasure had not been mine till I found the frightened bird on the
                        window screen.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, here you are at last, little lodger," I thought, and my heart bounded as
                        it had when I first discovered an oriole's nest. "We have slept in the same
                        house many spring nights," I said gently."You should not fear me now."</p>
                    <p>But the swallow said, with its every twitch, "Oh, please don't touch
                        me,&#8212;don't touch me!"</p>
                    <p>I watched it a minute, before setting it free. Swallows in motion,
                        gnat-catching, are more pleasing to look upon than swallows in repose. When
                        one is clinging to your screen, you think.</p>
                    <p>"What a queer, little, long-winged bird; dark with here and there touches of
                        weather-beaten-shingle gray; tiny black beak and strange stubby tail, with
                        extended spines that seem to <figure>
                            <figDesc>A nest with a note reading "Thrasher Estate.</figDesc>
                        </figure> hold it to the screen like black basting threads!"</p>
                    <p>Rather a mousy-looking little creature, somehow, it seemed to me. Its
                        prominent black eyes appeared to add to the suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of bright dark eyes, reminds me of the humming-bird that was
                        imprisoned one August day on my back porch. She&#8212;for the little
                        bird lacked the crimson throat that marks the male
                        hummer&#8212;frantically imagined herself a captive, till she found that
                        only the west end of the porch was incased in glass, and all the rest
                        consisted of railing and lattice work. But while she was discovering this, I
                        had an opportunity to watch her. </p>
                    <p>For a long time, I saw only a blinding grayish blur of perpetual motion. Then
                        the hummingbird paused on the framework of the window, and I noticed the
                        sheen on her splendid moss-green feathers, and marvelled at tiny black
                        claws, minute enough to have been fashioned from wire hairpins. I heard a
                        faint, "Chirp, chirp." Yet, when I was a child, someone had told me that
                        humming-birds made no sound aside from the buzzing produced by their wings
                        in motion.</p>
                    <p>While writing of sounds, I think of a songbird, the brown thrasher, and a
                        surprise that the thrashers once gave me. On a sunny morning in spring, I
                        came upon a pile of brush at the back of the orchard. Peeping at me through
                        the mass of twigs, was a certain old Plymouth rock hen, that I had always
                        suspected of being a little daft. Her ways were wild and strange. She
                        delighted in hatching eggs in outlandish places. I went to discover upon
                        what she was sitting. And what do you think I beheld just above Mrs.
                        Plymouth Rock? I found a brown thrasher there, nesting complacently in what
                        you might call the second story of the brush heap. her glassy yellow eyes
                        glared at me

                    <p>But who can account for the whims of birds? One summer day, a most amazing
                        sight met my eyes. Flat on the ground in the back pasture, I found the nest
                        of a mourning-dove! Mother Dove fluttered off, with that gentle, high-keyed
                        plaint that she uses in flight, and left me to gaze at the nest of faded
                        rootlets and two woefully ugly fledglings with long gray beaks. Their
                        shallow nest was on a particularly damp-looking spot of earth. After one
                        recovered from the shock of finding the brood on the ground, one's heart was
                        filled with pity. The sight was so cheerless.</p>
                    <p>I thought of the oriole's comely basket, high in the golden light, where it
                        swung from the tip of a poplar branch. I thought of a neat song-sparrow's
                        nest that I had just seen hidden under the "eaves" of a Norway spruce hedge,
                        where the song-sparrows spend the winter.</p>
                    <p>They come out on every mild morning to sing a little, even when Cardinal is
                        silent. You recall their sharp knife-like notes. Ever ready to make cheer,
                        the song-sparrows would seem to live a life free from trouble. yet they know
                        what it is to have their hedge haunted by wily cats, on winter evenings,
                        when the cold birds are fluttering to shelter; and at dusk, in spring, when
                        Mother Sparrow is directing her awkward, freckled birdlings to some nook for
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>Oh, I cannot tell how indignant it made me once to discover in the nest of
                        Mother Song-Sparrow, two cowbird eggs, flecked with cocoa-brown like hers,
                        but a trifle larger. Unsuspecting little Song-Sparrow, would have five
                        instead of three eggs to tend, while the cowbird went swaggering with her
                        noisy comrades up and down the pasture, in the wake of the cows.</p>
                    <p>As I write, this pasture is white with snow, for it is a January day, and
                        cold. Five crows have come up from the woods, to peck at the corn stubble in
                        what was once a pasture and then a cornfield. They strut over the snowy
                        surface and pull at the bits of stalk, but they never come to feast when I
                        feed Titmouse, <figure>

                            and stand before the armposts sof his court. For the Judge seeks wisdom
                            of his little ones, and longs to know the answer of a mighty riddle.
                            Yesterday was the Seventh Day, and as the Judge sat resting from his
                            labors, behold! an Aged Woman came and stood before him and glowered,
                            and said,</p>
                        <p>"Fun, Fun, there is not Fun."</p>
                        <p>Now I, the Judge, straightened in my chair and wrapped the ermine of my
                            cloak about me, and said:</p>
                        <p>"I will ask my Children."</p>
                        <p>Come, now, Children of the Judge, and tell me</p>

                        <head>WHAT IS FUN?</head>

                                >What is the mostest fun?"</hi></p>
                        <p>"You mustn't say, &#8212;"</p>
                        <p>never mind, Billy.</p>
                        <p>Bilikins has a great idea and when you think something, never mind how you
                            say it,&#8212;at least, never mind just then.</p>
                        <p>The question, then, which is brought before the Judge this morning,
                            Children, is</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <head>WHAT IS THE MOST FUN?</head>
                        <p><hi rend="ornamental">"T</hi>HERE," says Billy, "you corrected him."</p>
                        <p>Yes, but I did it gently, so as not to disturb him.</p>
                        <p>Now, Billy, I know what you think is the most fun,&#8212;and that is
                            TALKING. Just as soon as anybody learns how to talk, they like to talk,
                            and the more they talk, the more they like it. It is fun when you're
                            six, like Bilikins, and when you're ten, like Annie, and it is perfectly
                            fascinating when you get to be the age of Wilhelmina, and can sit in
                            the armchair or stand by the front-gate with your very best friends. Only
                            remember, the real joy in talking, depends a good deal on <hi
                                rend="italics">what</hi> you're talking.</p>
                        <p>"I know what is the most fun," says Annie; "it's EATING."</p>
                        <p>I sympathize with you, Annie, very deeply. Eating is certainly a joy.
                            Consider once,&#8212;fried chicken, biscuits, and chocolate-covered
                            nuts, and <hi rend="italics">Pie</hi>. BUT don't over-eat. If you do,
                            then when you get grown up, you'll have a sort of perpetual tummy-ache,
                            which people call dyspepsia, and you'll think this a very, very wicked
                            world.</p>
                        <p>"I know what is really the most fun," interrupts
                            Bilikins,&#8212;"it's TAG."</p>
                        <p>There is deep wisdom in what you say, Bilikins. When we were little like
                            you, we realized that muscles were given us to be used. As we grow
                            older, we seem to assume that they are simply places to put fat on.
                            People, then, who use their muscles, either in tag, or waling to work,
                            or carrying cola, will be happiest IF along with their working, whey
                            learn to think and have time to rest.</p>
                        <p>William stammers, "READING is best."</p>
                        <p>Millions and millions of people, living and dead and gone, agree with
                            you, William. If talking with your friends is fun, then reading with the
                            greatest Friends that ever lived, is more than fun,&#8212;it is a
                            miracle.</p>
                        <p>But there are two difficulties. The first is that so few people learn how
                            to read; they skim and skip and half understand and don't use the
                            dictionary; and then, worse than that, still fewer people know <hi
                                rend="italics">what</hi> to read. It is fine to have a friend, and
                            yet you would not make friends with a burglar or a scamp&#8212;that
                            is, not usually. It is fine to read, but there are some things not worth
                            reading, and there are other things more than worth.</p>
                        <p>"What?" asks William.</p>
                        <p>We shall have to leave that for another session, my son.</p>
                        <p>"Personally," says Wilhelmina, as she arranges her "dog
                            ears",&#8212;"personally, I prefer DANCING."</p>
                        <p>But there are several kinds of dancing, and this is a case where once a
                            bad kind got to be so common that a large number of good people said <hi
                                rend="italics">all</hi> dancing is bad. This, of course, is not
                            true.</p>

                            dancing in honor of the Lord, and you know what fun the little folk
                            dances are in school.</p>
                        <p>There is no finer exercise to make people stand up and walk well and look
                            good, than dancing; but to be at its best, dancing should be done in the
                            open air, among friends and neighbors and parents, and it should not
                            last all night.</p>

                            session for these. Meantime, I am afraid we shall have to swallow the
                            little pill which is called a moral: all the <hi rend="ornamental"

                            The place is too small, it's killing me; my soul calls for larger
                            things, so I appeal to you. I have been called odd,&#8212;in fact, I

                            that's why I am sending my work on plain paper, and if you don't publish
                            it, burn it up ....</p>

                            paper, with two covers with holes punched through and tied together with
                            a string. In it I keep all the pictures I can find of interesting
                            colored people and the interesting things they do. I have pictures of
                            Frederick Douglas, Bishop Allen, Harriet Tubman, Paul Lawrence Dunbar,
                            and lots of others. I like the pictures especially. But now that I am
                            reading THE BROWNIES' BOOK, I see there must be a lot of important
                            colored people that I didn't know about. I'd love to see pictures of
                            Katy Ferguson and Captain Cuffee. If you have them, won't you print
                            them, so I can cut them out and put them in my book!</p>

                            were in the country. I was only about seven years old. How I managed it,
                            I don't know; but I made a raft and poled my way about three miles down
                            the Delaware River. When they found me, I was lying on the bank asleep,
                            with tears on my cheeks. If there were any chance of getting in the
                            Navy, I'd enlist when I get through school. But, anyway, I sure know I'm
                            going to travel, just like Captain Cuffee. Maybe I'll go to Africa,

                            as musicians, that they have to do other things to help make their
                            living, and that I might just as well start doing this first as last. Of

                        would slowly fill with tears; she did so want a truly mother. </p>
                    <p>When she fell and bumped her head, nobody was there to kiss it for her. When
                        she cut her finger, the nurse bathed and dressed it and she was given a
                        lecture on her carelessness and sent to bed. Every night, before she went to
                        bed, Patsy would step into the Faculty Room and look at herself in the long
                        mirror. Black curly hair, (Patsy always looked at her good points first)
                        big, black eyes, long eyelashes, white teeth, and a nose that Patsy thought
                        was all right; but, skinny arms and legs, large mouth, and&#8212;<hi
                            rend="italics">freckles!</hi> Then Patsy would creep upstairs and cry
                        herself to sleep. Nobody wanted a little girl with freckles.</p>
                    <p>Not long after this, something happened to change Patsy's whole outlook on
                        life. Around the corner, on Madison Square, was a rich woman, Mrs. Kingsley,
                        who was giving a drama for charity, and she needed a little girl for one of
                        the characters. So one afternoon she came over to the Home, and said,</p>
                    <p>"Which one of you little girls would like to have a truly mother?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I would!" shouted everybody at once.</p>
                    <p>"But it's only pretend," said the lady hastily.</p>
                    <p>"O-ooooh," and everyone sat down.</p>
                    <p>That is, everyone but Patsy, who came eagerly forward and said, "Oh, please,
                        please let me pretend !"</p>
                    <p>You see, Patsy wanted a mother so badly, she was even willing to pretend she
                        had one. So the lady decided to let Patsy pretend.</p>
                    <p>Every afternoon Patsy went over to the big house on Madison Square to
                        rehearse for the play; and at last the night of the entertainment arrived.
                        Patsy carried off the honors; and for the first time in her life Patsy was
                        kissed and 
                        <pb facs="brownies.192004.022.jpg"/>
                        <fw>116</fw><fw>THE BROWNIES' BOOK</fw> petted and everyone said,</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italics">Isn't</hi> she a dear little girl?"</p>
                    <p>Evidently Mrs. Kingsley thought so, too, judging from the way she hugged and
                        kissed Patsy.</p>
                    <p> At last, when all the guest had gone, and the large house was quiet, Mrs.
                        Kingsley drew Patsy towards her, and said slowly, "Patsy,
                        would&#8212;would you like to live here always and have me for a really,
                        truly mother?" </p>
                    <p>"Oh! Oh!! Oh!!!" shrieked Patsy.</p>
                    <p>And then Patsy was caught in a long, lingering embrace.</p>
                    <p>That night, while Patsy was being rocked to sleep, she said as she was dozing
                        off, "I like it, I do."</p>
                    <p>Patsy had at last found a really, truly mother.</p>

                        <head>PERFECT CHILDREN</head>
                        <p><hi rend="ornamental">W</hi>OULDN'T you like to be perfect?</p>
                        <p>Among our "Little People of the Month" this time, we have four children
                            whose little bodies are perfect. For instance, there's George P. Moore,
                            of Portland, Oregon, who won a score of 99% in a eugenics test; George
                            W. Bassett, Jr., of Winston-Salem, N. C., who is lying on his back and
                            cooing, was registered 100% at the Baby Clinic, and weighed 19 1/2
                            pounds when he was five month old; beautiful little Clara Kersey
                            Jackson, of Richmond, Va., is a 100% baby; George E. M. Cannady, who
                            lives way up in Portland, Oregon, too, and was three years and three
                            months old when this picture was taken, is a fine husky, chap.</p>
                        <p>Now this all means, not that these children are necessarily going to be
                            perfect men and women, but that because they begin with perfect bodies,
                            they are going to have an easier chance to have perfect souls.</p>
                        <p>One of the most distressing things about our people is the number of
                            poor, unhealthy children who come into the world. In some sections, half
                            of the colored children born, die before they are one year old, because
                            their parents are poor and poorly-paid and because the city does not
                            give them decent places in which to live and play.</p>
                        <p>But these children have made the first great step in life&#8212;their
                            bodies are perfect. Next comes the perfect mind, and finally the perfect
                            soul.</p>

                            Coleman, born in Africa, has come to the United States, and lives in
                            Charleston, S.C. Dorothy is the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Coleman, who
                            are missionaries.</p>

                            sake of Justice. Among the brave men called, was the father of Mary
                            Evans Wiley of Pittsburgh, Pa. Mr. Wiley served in France, as a

                        <p>Did you know that Frederick Douglass had five names, too? His mother
                            named him Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; then a friend of his

                            arithmetic. She can wash dishes, sweep the floor and the yard, trade for
                            her mother at the market, grocery, and dry goods stores, and take
                            checks to the bank. Her mother says: "You can send her with any amount
                            of money up to Ten Dollars, and she will bring back the correct

                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">N</hi>OW that the right of women to vote is gradually
                        being conceded throughout the United States, few people stop to realize for
                        how many years women have had to work and fight and wait in order to reach
                        this goal. Even our boys and girls remember the disrepute in which
                        suffragettes were held in England prior to, and even at the beginning of,
                        the World War. And some echo of that unpopularity crossed the seas and was
                        heard again in the treatment given not long ago, in this country, to the
                        advocates of Woman Suffrage in Washington.</p>
                    <p>However, to women who many, many years ago, started the movement, and watched
                        its course often with an anxious, though never with a despairing eye, the

                        </figure> of suffrage for women today would seem nothing short of a miracle.
                        History can hardly emphasize too strongly what of shame, ridicule, and
                        disappointment those true heroines were called upon to endure.</p>
                    <p>To one of those early leaders of women the disfavor arising from being
                        associated with the unpopular cause of Woman Suffrage meant nothing, for she
                        had long since been associated with a cause far more
                        unpopular,&#8212;that of Abolition. </p>
                    <p>Sojourner Truth,&#8212;for that was the remarkable name of this
                        extremely remarkable woman,&#8212;was born an American slave. The exact
                        date of her birth is not known, but it is generally granted that she must have
                        been born between 1785 and 1798. She belonged to a man named Ardinburgh,
                        who lived in Huley, Ulster County, New York. Her name in those early days
                        was Isabella, and this she kept for many years. Isabella's life was a sad
                        one. She was a sensitive child and while still very, very young she received
                        impressions of one of the chief horrors of slavery,&#8212;that of
                        separations of slave parents from children. This remained with her all her
                        life. She herself shows, unconsciously, how tragic her childhood must have
                        been when she relates this incident.</p>
                    <p> "I can remember," she says, "when I was a little, young girl, how my old
                        mammy would sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and
                        groan, and I would say, 'Mammy, what makes you groan so and she would reply,
                        'I am groaning to think of my poor children: they do not know where I be and
                        I don't know where they be. I look up at the stars and they look at the
                        stars!'"</p>
                    <p>It was among such sad conditions as these that Isabella grew into young
                        womanhood. In the course of time she married and had many children. One of
                        these was a son who, while still a mere youth, was stolen away and sold
                        outside of New York, his native state, Even in those sad times there were
                        laws in New York forbidding the selling of slaves outside the state
                        boundaries, but these were violated in this case. This slave-mother had
                        already seen the suffering caused her own mother by the loss of her
                        children; now she realized that the same anguish had come to her, and might
                        befall her many, many times.</p>
                    <p>From that time on she began a violent protest against slavery which never
                        ceased until finally that curse was lifted from the land. This was made
                        the more possible by the fact, that in 1827 she received her freedom by a law
                        which granted freedom to all slaves, in the state of New York, at the age
                        of forty.</p>
                    <p>She had a long and remarkable career, and did many strange and unusual
                        things. Among others, she changed her name, about 1837, to Sojourner Truth
                        and that was the name by which she was called ever after.</p>

                    <p>Many of her striking sayings have come down to us. People tell how Frederick
                        Douglass once showed plainly that he was very much discouraged at a meeting
                        in Boston, and seemed to doubt if slavery ever could be wiped out. Then
                        Sojourner Truth rose slowly from her place in the audience and stretching
                        forth a long arm, exclaimed: "Frederick, is God dead?"</p>

                    <fw>THE BROWNIES' BOOK</fw>
                    <p>On another occasion a white man asked her at the close of a lecture if she
                        supposed anybody really minded her talks against slavery. "I don't care any
                        more for your talk," said he, "than I do for the bite of a flea."</p>
                    <p>"That may be," said Sojourner Truth, "but with God's help, I'm going to keep
                        you scratching."</p>
                    <p>Long before the Civil War, she was lending her influence and eloquence to
                        Woman Suffrage. Her mind was so keen and so broad that she quickly realized
                        that the refusal of the right to vote to women, was only another form of
                        slavery.</p>
                    <p>The second State Woman Suffrage Convention of Ohio was held in Akron, May 28
                        and 29, 1851. Sojourner Truth was present both days. On the second day the
                        meeting was very stormy: several ministers who were present spoke very
                        strongly against "votes for women". One said men had superior rights,
                        because men had intellects superior to women's. Another said that the fact
                        that Christ was a man proved that God considered women inferior to men.
                        Things were going very badly for the suffrage cause, when Sojourner Truth
                        arose to speak. Some of the leaders were afraid to have her talk, fearing
                        she would make the cause ridiculous, and they urged the presiding officer,
                        Mrs. Frances Dana Gage, to silence her. But Mrs. Gage was brave and rose and
                        announced in the midst of a great hubbub,&#8212;"Sojourner Truth!"</p>
                    <p>Immediately all the confusion died away, for everyone, whether approving of
                        Woman Suffrage or not, wanted to hear this wonderful woman. She must have
                        been an impressive figure as she stood there, for she was very tall and
                        dark, with a keen, unflinching eye. Her full deep tones resounded through
                        the hall. Being uneducated, of course, she spoke in dialect or broken
                        English, which I shall not attempt to reproduce here, though her speech,
                        evidently, lost nothing by its use.</p>
                    <p>She pointed to one of the disapproving ministers,&#8212;</p>
                    <p>"That man over there," she began, "says that women need to be helped into
                        carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best help everywhere.
                        Nobody ever helps me into carriages or over mud-puddles, or gives me the
                        best place. Well, I'm a woman, ain't I? Look at my arm," she went on, "look
                        at my arm! And she bared her right arm to the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>"I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head
                        me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a
                        man,&#8212;when I could get it&#8212;and bear the lash as well. And
                        ain't I a woman! I have borne thirteen children, and seen them most all sold
                        off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus
                        heard me! And ain't I a woman?</p>
                    <p>"Then they talk about this thing in the head, what do they call it?" Some one
                        nearby told her "intellect." She nodded her head vigorously. "That's it,
                        honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or niggers' right? If my
                        cup won't hold but a pint and yours a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let
                        me have my little half-measure full?</p>
                    <p>"Then that little man in black over there, says women can't have as much
                        rights as men, because Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come
                        from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him!" Sojourner Truth
                        had won the day as the deafening applause acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>She was an old, old woman when she died in 1883,&#8212;very nearly a
                        hundred years old. Her life had been "full of weary days, But good things
                        had not kept aloof."</p>
                    <p>In some respects her life seems more wonderful than any fairy tale that ever
                        was written. She had been a slave: she had lived to see not only herself set
                        free, but to see slaves set free all over the country. And she had helped to
                        bring it to pass. She, who had started out in life as nobody, numbered the
                        greatest man in the country, President Lincoln, among her friends.
                        Absolutely uneducated and untrained, she sat in council with some of the
                        most advanced minds of her day. And the cause of Woman Suffrage is in her
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>Indeed her interest in this cause is the surest proof that she was a sincere
                        advocate of liberty. For though the needs of her own people were so
                        pressing, she felt that it was also her business to help the cause of all
                        womankind.</p>
                    <p>No tablet, so far as I know, has been erected to her memory. But her own life
                        is her best memorial. As a great Roman poet said hundreds of years ago,
                        before Sojourner Truth had died, or was born, she "raised a monument more
                        enduring than bronze, Which shall last throughout the years."</p>

                    <head>THE TWIN HEROES</head>
                    <byline>An African Myth Adapted by ALPHONSO O. STAFFORD</byline>
                    <p><hi rend="ornamental">I</hi>N that far-off time when the world was young,
                        there lived in a town of a powerful king, a widow whose name was Isokah, and
                        whose husband, a brave warrior, had fallen in battle.</p>
                    <p>She had two baby sons, called Mansur and Luembur. They were twins, with
                        bodies round and shapely, the color of dull gold. At their birth an old man,
                        known for his gift of prophecy, had said, "Twins are a gift of Anambia, the
                        Great Spirit, and they have been sent to us for a special work."</p>
                    <p>Everyone in that town, knowing how true were the sayings of the old man,
                        believed thereafter that the twin babes of Isokah would grow into manhood
                        and become warriors of note and possibly heroes of great renown.</p>
                    <p>When they were six weeks old, their mother planted in her garden, a short
                        distance apart, two seeds. With great care she watered the earth about and
                        when the seeds sprouted and became tiny plants, her care for them did not
                        cease.</p>
                    <p>As the years passed, Isokah's two sons grew tall, strong, and pleasing to the
                        eye, like the graceful pine trees around their home. In play, in the hunt,
                        and in deeds of daring, these two boys always took first place among their
                        companions. Meanwhile, the two plants grew into fine trees with beautiful
                        spreading foliage. When Mansur and Luembur were old enough to understand,
                        Isokah took each of them to one of the trees, and said,</p>
                    <p>"This, my son, is your life tree. As it thrives, withers, or dies, so you
                        will grow, be in peril, Or perish."</p>
                    <p>After that day, Mansur and Luembur watched his own tree with increasing
                        interest and felt for it a loving tenderness when resting under its
                        spreading branches during the heat of the day, or in the cool of the
                        evening, while listening to the strange cries in the jungle; or gazing with
                        wonder at the dear sky with its brilliant stars, and the silver crescent
                        changing nightly into a great golden ball.</p>
                    <p>How happy was Isokah as she watched her boys grow into early manhood, and the
                        life trees thrive in strength and beauty with them.</p>
                    <p>During this time, Mansur had many strange dreams,&#8212;dreams of great
                        perils in the jungle, dreams of different lands,&#8212; but more often
                        he had visions of Yuah, the daughter of Zambay, who was Old Mother Earth,
                        the first daughter of the first father.</p>
                    <p>Yuah was said to be beautiful. Her beauty was like the dusk at twilight, when
                        the stars begin to twinkle in the afterglow of the Western sky.</p>
                    <p>One day, after Mansur had passed his twentieth year, he said to his mother,
                        "The time has come for me to marry and I am going in search of Yuah, the
                        daughter of Old Mother Earth."</p>
                    <p>Though her sorrow was great when she heard these words, Isokah knew that she
                        could not always keep her son near her. So she called upon Muzimu, a wizard
                        of strange power and asked him for some magic to help her son, Mansur, in
                        his quest.</p>
                    <p>When this was given, she returned and gave it to him, saying, "My son, this
                        is your magic. I shall guard your life tree while you are away and Luembur,
                        your brother, will watch over me."</p>
                    <p>Mansur then put his strong arms around his mother's shoulders, bowed his head
                        upon her cheek, and gave her his farewell kiss. Then, taking from her the
                        magic, he touched some grass he had plucked from the ground. One blade was
                        changed into a horn, another into a knife, and still another into a
                        spear.</p>
                    <p>Before leaving, he called Luembur, saying. "Brother, be ever near mother
                        Isokah, and let no harm befall her."</p>
                    <p>For days and days Mansur travelled. What a picture of natural beauty met his
                        eye everywhere! How verdant was the foliage of the trees, shrubs, and plants
                        of the African plains and highlands; how sparkling the streams that foamed
                        over rocky beds of granite and sandstone, how beautiful was the coloring of
                        the flowers, how gay was the plumage of the birds, how graceful and striking
                        in size were the animals that fled before him as he pushed his way 
                        <pb facs="brownies.192004.032.jpg"/>
                        <fw>126</fw><fw>THE BROWNIES' BOOK</fw> onward to the land of Zambay, the
                        mother of his desired Yuah. When overcome by hunger, Mansur called upon his
                        magic for food. </p>
                    <p>At last, the far country of Zambay was reached. Whenever a stranger entered
                        it, he was escorted at once to Zambay, the queen, the all powerful ruler of
                        that land. The usual custom followed, when Mansur was seen striding forward
                        with his spear in hand, horn across shoulder, and knife at side.</p>
                    <p>Standing near her mother, Yuah saw the stranger,&#8212;saw him in his
                        strength and in his early manhood, so lithe in movement and so <figure>
                            <figDesc>Mansur and Yuah</figDesc>
                            <head>"Do let me see it," urged Mansur</head>
                        </figure> fearless in bearing. Straightway her heart warmed to him. How
                        happy was Mansur when he beheld this dream-girl as a reality and saw in her
                        eyes, a look of friendly interest that passed into admiration when he
                        recited the story of his travels and the purpose of his visit.</p>
                    <p>Three days later, they were married. A fine feast was held, followed by
                        joyous singing and a merry dance. The finest house in the town was given to
                        the bride and groom, where for many months their happiness was complete.</p>
                    <p>One day, while idling in his new home, Mansur opened the door of a strange
                        room which he had never noticed. In it were many mirrors, each covered so
                        that the glass could not be seen. Calling Yuah, he asked her to remove the
                        covers so that he might examine them. She took him to one, uncovered it, and
                        Mansur immediately saw a perfect likeness of his native town; then to
                        another, and he saw his mother and his brother, Luembur, sitting in peace
                        beneath his life tree. In each mirror he saw something that carried his
                        memory back to his past life and the country of his birth.</p>
                    <p>Coming to the last mirror, larger than the others, Mansur was filled with a
                        strange foreboding. Yuah did not uncover it. "Why not let me look into it,
                        Yuah?" asked Mansur.</p>
                    <p>"Because, my beloved one, in it you will see reflected the land of Never
                        Return&#8212;from it none returns who wanders there."</p>
                    <p>Now this remark made Mansur very curious, <pb facs="brownies.192004.033.jpg"/>
                        <fw>127</fw><fw>THE BROWNIES' BOOK</fw> and he longed as never before, to
                        see this mirror that would picture so strange a land or so mysterious a
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>"Do let me see it," urged Mansur. Yielding at last to his entreaties, Yuah
                        uncovered the mirror, and her young husband saw reflected therein that dread
                        land of the lower world&#8212;that unsought place of cruel King Kalungo,
                        of which all men had heard. Mansur looked in the mirror a long time, then he
                        said,</p>
                    <p>"I must go there; I must leave you, my dear."</p>
                    <p>"Nay, you will never return; please do not go, my beloved one," pleaded
                        Yuah.</p>
                    <p>"Have no fear," answered Mansur. "The magic of Muzimu will be my protection.
                        Should any harm befall me, my twin brother, Luembur, will come to my
                        rescue."</p>
                    <p>Now this made Yuah cry and she was very, very sad, but her tears did not move
                        Mansur from his desire and his purpose.</p>
                    <p>In a few hours he had departed for the Land of Never Return.</p>
                    <p>After travelling many days, Mansur came upon a weird old woman working in the
                        fields. In her eyes, there was mystery; in her presence, there came to him a
                        feeling of awe. Though he knew not then, she was the never sleeping spirit
                        that guarded the secrets of the Land of Never Return.</p>
                    <p>Approaching her, Mansur said, "My good woman, please show me the road to the
                        land whence no man returns who wanders there."</p>
                    <p>The old woman, pausing in her work, looked at him as he stood there, so tall
                        and straight. A smile passed over her wrinkled face as she recognized in
                        Mansur one of the true heroes for whose coming she had waited many
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Much to his surprise, the old woman, after a long and deep gaze, said,</p>
                    <p>"Mansur. I know you and I shall direct your way, though the task before you
                        is one of peril. Go down that hill to your right, take the narrow path, and
                        avoid the wide one. After an hour's travel, you will come to the dread home
                        of Kalungo, the Land of Never Return. Before reaching his abode, you must
                        pass a fierce dog that guards his gate, fight the great serpent of seven
                        heads within the courtyard, and destroy the mighty crocodile that sleeps in
                        the pool."</p>
                    <p>These impending dangers did not frighten Mansur. Following the narrow path,
                        he came within a short time to a deep ravine. Through this he walked, head
                        erect, eyes alert, and spear uplifted. Suddenly he observed the outer gate
                        of the Land of Never Return.</p>
                    <p>By means of his magic, he passed the fierce dog, and after a severe battle he
                        succeeded in destroying the serpent, that seven-headed monster. Near the
                        pool, he saw the mighty crocodile resting on its bank, and rushed forward to
                        strike him. Then, by accident, Mansur's magic fell upon the ground, and
                        immediately he was seized by the crocodile and disappeared within his
                        terrible mouth.</p>
                    <p>At home, his mother, Isokah, and brother, Luembur, noticed with fear that the
                        life tree of Mansur had suddenly withered.</p>
                    <p>"Mother, my brother is in danger. I must go at once in search of him," cried
                        Luembur.</p>
                    <p>Rushing to Muzimu, the wizard, Isokah procured some more magic, returned home
                        and gave it to Luembur and besought him to go immediately in search of his
                        twin brother.</p>
                    <p>As he departed, a great weakness seized her, and supporting herself for
                        awhile against the trunk of Luembur's life tree, she slowly sank to the
                        ground, with a foreboding that she would never again see her sons.</p>
                    <p>When Luembur reached the town of Zambay, she was much struck with the
                        resemblance he bore to his brother, and Yuah was overjoyed that he had come
                        to go in search of Mansur. She noticed with pleasure that Luembur also
                        carried the same kind of spear, horn, and knife that Mansur had.</p>
                    <p>Yuah showed him the magic mirrors, reserving for the last the fateful one
                        that had caused Mansur to depart for the Land of Never Return.</p>
                    <p>After resting awhile. Luembur continued his journey and, as in the case of
                        his brother, came after many days to the weird old woman working in the
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>The story of his quest was soon told. After it was finished, she said, "I
                        know you, also, Luembur." She then gave him the same directions.</p>
                    <p>When he reached the gates of the Land of Kalungo, the fierce dog fell before
                        the magic spear of Luembur. Then rushing to the bank of the pool where the
                        mighty crocodile was dozing in the sun, Luembur with one great blow of his
                        spear slew him. Then taking his knife he cut along the under side of the
                        dead crocodile <pb facs="brownies.192004.034.jpg"/>

                        </figure> and, strange to state, Mansur jumped out, well and happy.</p>
                    <p>Swift as the wind, the twin brothers left the gates of the dread Land of
                        Never Return and travelled upward to the place where the weird old woman
                        worked in the field, under the rays of the glinting sun.</p>
                    <p>When she beheld them, she stood erect, a deeper mystery flashed into her
                        age-old eyes, and in her presence, there returned to the brothers, that same
                        feeling of awe, but now more intense.</p>
                    <p>Finally she spoke, "Brothers, by slaying the fierce dog, the terrible
                        serpent, and the mighty crocodile, you have released the spirits of the
                        brave, the wise, and the good, who were prisoners in the realm of cruel
                        Kalungo. They may now return to Mother Earth when they desire, and visit the
                        abode of their mortal existence. Your task here below is now finished.</p>
                    <p>"You, Mansur. shall be Lightning, that mortals may ever see your swift spear
                        as it darts through the clouds; and you, Luembur, shall be Thunder, that
                        mortals may ever hear and know the power of that flashing spear."</p>
                    <p>With these words, the sleepless spirit of the Land of Never Return touched
                        each of the brothers, and Mansur went to the East and became the swift,
                        darting lightning; and Luembur went to the West and became the loud, pealing
                        thunder.</p>
                    <p>In the land of Zambay, when Yuah, through her magic mirror, saw what had
                        happened to the brothers, she cried with much grief. Neither by day nor by
                        night would she be comforted.</p>
                    <p>At last her mother, Zambay, said in a gentle and sad voice, "My daughter,
                        when your husband, Mansur, and his brother, Luembur, are angry in their
                        home, amid the clouds, and have frightened men and beasts, here in my land,
                        your beauty and your smile will bring them joy. At such times, your body
                        clothed with many colors, will bend and touch me, your Mother Earth. Go
                        hence, and live with them.</p>
                    <p>With these words. Yuah went away from the home of her mother, and we see her
                        now as the beautiful Rainbow, after the storm clouds of Mansur and Luembur
                        have passed on their way to the home of The All Father, the Great
                        Sky-Spirit, Anambia. </p>
