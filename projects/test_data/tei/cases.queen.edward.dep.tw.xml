                    where Capt. <persName>John Jiams</persName>, now deceased, was Inspector, and
                    the said Inspector was going to mark the tobacco with the name of the deponent
                    when the deponent told him not, but to mark it with the name of <persName><choice><sic>John
                        Carrick</sic> <corr>James Carroll</corr></choice></persName>,
                    priest, upon
                    which the said Capt. <persName>John Jiams</persName> then asked the deponent if
                    he knew old <persName>Phillis</persName> who lived at the quarter, to which he
                    answered that he did know her very well; the deponent then asked the said
                    <persName>John Jiams</persName> if he knew her, and he answered he knew her very
                    well and said she was as free as he was if she had her right; the deponent then
                    asked him how she came to be free, and he answered that <del>cc</del> her mother was
                    free and was brought into this Country by Captain <persName>Larkin</persName>

                    the said <persName>Jiams</persName> told him that she was sold to one of the
                    <persName>Chapman</persName>s; and he further says that the said Captain
                    <persName>Jiams</persName> told him that her name was <persName>Mary
                        Queen</persName>, to the best of his recollection; and that she afterwards
                    belonged to <persName>James <choice><sic>Carrick</sic> <corr>Carroll</corr></choice></persName> who lived at <placeName>Fingal</placeName> in <placeName>Ann
