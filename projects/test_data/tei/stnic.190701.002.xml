                <p>AUNT MANDY'S face beamed with satisfaction as she put the finishing touches to
                    her Christmas tree. She laughed softly. Never <figure>
                        <figDesc>Four children decorating a Christmas tree as a man and woman
                            watch</figDesc>
                        <head>"De 'freshments am free an' malicious."</head>
                    </figure> in all her experience had she trimmed such a tree as this. And she had
                    trimmed many.</p>
                <p>"Well, sah! no one nebber made Christmas trees out'n umbrellas in my time," said
                    Aunt Mandy, "but them chillun's boun' to hab sumpin' to hang dey praisents on,
                    an dat sho am jes' a hifalutin tree!" She stood with her hands on her hips and
                    surveyed the tree intently. </p>
                <p>The frame of the old umbrella spread its bare ribs above an empty soap box to
                    which the handle had been rudely fastened. Strings of popcorn and cranberries
                    afforded the principal decorations, while cookies, apples and sticks of candy
                    were suspended by strings of various kinds and colors. The presents consisted of
                    mysterious looking bundles of many shapes and sizes.</p>
                <p>Aunt Mandy had worked long and patiently, and now she turned away, saying as she
                    closed the door behind her; "Clar' to goodness, hit do look mighty
                    scrumptious&#8212; 'deed hit do!"</p>
                <p>Only a few hours more, and the tree in all its grandeur would be displayed. Never
                    had there been such excitement in Aunt Mandy's cabin. The pickaninnies, dressed
                    in their Sunday-best, indulged in low whispers and smothered giggles. Even the
                    perky bows on 'Liza's and Maria's pigtails seemed to stir with life and quiver
                    with eagerness.</p>
                <p>Supper over, Uncle Mose led the <unclear reason="torn"/> to <pb
                        facs="stnic.190701.002.002.jpg"/> the best room. As he threw open the door, a
                    shout went up from the delighted pickaninnies. </p>
                <p>"Chillun," said Uncle Mose, with a low bow and a flourish of the hand, "on dis
                    mos' 'spicuous 'casion, yo' suttinly hab a lubbly tree to celebrate yo' Krismus
                    day. An' I will now reced to constribute yo' praisents.</p>
                <p>"Fust, foahmos', an' to begin wid, I puhsent yo', George Washington Lincoln
                    Harrison Grant, wid a pair o' skates, from yo' lubbin mammy.</p>
                <p>"An yo', 'Rastus Robinson Carter Keller, gits a football from yo' 'fectionate
                    daddy.</p>
                <p>"Liza Jane Arabella Helen, git right up on yo' feet an' make yo' bow. I puhsent
                    yo' wid a bran' new dress from yo' lubbin mammy.</p>
                <p>"Maria Melissa Wallace Winifred, what yo' gwine to say to yo' mammy when yo'
                    'cepts dis bonnet, de work ob her lubbin han's? Now, chillun, yo' can walk up
                    an' he'p yo'se'fs. De 'freshments am free an' malicious."</p>
                <p>With a wild howl the youngsters made a rush for the spreading ree. "Dey's mo'
                    praisents!" "Golly, what's dis?" "Huc-come dis heah?" "De tree's ben'in over!"
                    "Hol' on!" were the exclamations that came crowding one upon another. Then the
                    uproar became deafening, and the Christmas folic was on. </p>
                <p>Uncle Mose stood for a moment in happy contemplation, then his eyes fell on Aunt
                    Mandy's smiling face. "Mandy Mehitable Sonora Frances Somers," he said, "yo'
                    'strabagance an' he'plessness befo', an' I's glad, 'deed I is, honey&#8212;'case
                    I nevah 'spected hit." Uncle Mose bowed, waved his hands airily and took his
                    seat. The perspiration stood in beads on his forehead, but his smile did not
                    vanish. Christmas cheer was stirring in his heart, and Christmas angels were
                    hovering over the little cabin.</p>
                <p>When the clock on the mantel struck the midnight hour, doors were locked, lights
                    snuffed out and silence fell upon the happy home. Little black faces smiled up
                    from soft, white pillows, for their dreams were sweet that Christmas night. Aunt
                    Mandy felt well repaid for all her extra care and trouble, and Uncle Mose,
                    wearied with his speech-making, soon fell asleep.</p>
                <p>The old umbrella, bare and forlorn, stood in the darkened corner, stretching its
                    bent ribs into vacancy. It had fulfilled its mission. Christmas without a tree
                    and Christmas with an umbrella was a success in Aunt Mandy's cabin.</p>
