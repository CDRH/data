<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>N.Y. Eve. Post has a fine display article by Katherine Lee Bates, head Dept. of English at Wellesley - a wholly appreciative review. Couldn't be better. <u>Midland</u> has a fine page article; wholly appreciative. Both of these say just what you and I believe about the <u>Wars.</u></p>

<p>I <u>do</u> hope yours will be accepted by the Saturday Review. If, by any chance, it should be rejected, try at once on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, sending it in care of Paul Greer, Mg. Editor.</p>

<p>Later I'll send you a collection of reviews. You'll get more satisfaction that way.</p>

<p>I judge that the Midland article was done by paper.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Lots of love,</span>

<br/>Jno.
</span>
<p>The campaign has started in a most promising manner, surely.</p>

<p>Remember, Greer <u>was</u> editor of the Bee before he climbed to his present job in St. Louis.</p>
                
<div class="note">Your review ought to go in Sat. Rev. It can not be more complementary than the Eve. Post article; + it's a more complete appraisal I know.</div>
