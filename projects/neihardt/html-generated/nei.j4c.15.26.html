      <p>You quote Edmund Wilson in your last, evidently believing that he is a man deserving
         the attention of an intelligent man like yourself. I am sending you a copy of the
         latest book by this pink tea lizard, that you may know more about him. You need read
         no more in this book than the study of Gertrude Stein. We have reached a point where
         you may take this as a safe axiom: Wherever there are any leaders in any realm of
         human activity, including the cultural realm, you will find fools more conspicuous.
         The simple fact is that western society is uncurably insane.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>But that is an unpleasant matter. Of course I take your suggestion "at all seriously"
         as to rewriting your book, and I am genuinely interested, but for no personal reason
         as you might suppose. You could make a fine thing of that now,  I am sure.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How good it is that Mary is so prosperously and happily married! This must give you
         much solid satisfaction when you think of it.
      </p>
