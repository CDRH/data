      <p>That sounds good, but I will not hold you rigidly to the fifty guarantee if the thing
         should flop. 
         <u>When</u> can I get to Boston, if I am with you Friday night? I have not the proper letter
         here, but I seem to remember something about Dana Hall on Sunday afternoon. Maybe
         it's evening, though. I hope so. Yes, things do happen - steadily. I'm surprised at
         the vitality of my stuff in such a time. My God, books are as common as flies! Nearly
         everything is forgotten inside of a year.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Scribners have just published an American Lit. for high schools and colleges in which
         Neihardt is said to be "regarded as the foremost representative of the epic in American
         Literature". I don't know the orthur. Somebody 
         <del class=""></del> who is at the head of  Washington D.C. high schools.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Things go well. I have no personal reasons for grouching about the present trend.
         
         <u>I</u> am winning. My reputation seems secure and growing, and Macmillans say it won't stop.
         I am making money enough to put me in the upper 10% I understand. But, damn it, I'd rather be a petty farmer and think only high thoughts.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm impressed by your letter head. Hurrah sincerely!</p>
