      <p>I cannot see how it is possible for me to do the Robinson article. Last week I received
         a letter from Encyclopedia Britannica asking why I had not turned in the articles
         on the Missori and Platte Rivers for the new edition. I see no possibility of writing
         those articles, and you know how much the opportunity means to me. The fact is, I
         am worn thin all the time and never get any relief from the tension of me job. And
         there is no relief in sight. It is either over-work or over-worry for me.
