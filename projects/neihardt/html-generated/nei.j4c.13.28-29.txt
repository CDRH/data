      <p>I hope that by this time Mrs. House is feeling herself again, and you may be sure
         that we were all genuinely sorry to hear of her sickness. Give her kindest thoughts
         from all of us here.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How are things going with you? Don't you feel an uplift when you think of your quarterly?
         I should think you would. It is fine for you to have that job on your hands by way
         of feeding the best in you. And you are certainly making a go of it so far as merit
         is concerned.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>No doubt you thought of my investments when the Market had its little bust a couple
         weeks ago. I thought of writing you not to worry, but many things drive me, and I
         have a deuce of a time writing to my mother. In the evenings I usually flop. I carried
         430 shares through the break without a margin call, and am in excellent position to
         make a killing early in February. Am away ahead of the game now. Did you notice what
         Pennsylvania is doing?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have a very strong hunch that I may be drawn away from here. Can't explain it, but
         February seems the critical time. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Nothing</u>
      </p>
      <p> has happened here to make me feel so.

         I sent the manuscript of STRAWS IN THE WIND to Macmillans last Friday, and the book
         should appear in the spring. Surely it is worth publishing. I was a bit surprised
         at the stuff when I set about editing it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Write me something nice. Tell me you care for me sincerely as in the blessed years
         before we were so widely separated geographically. 
         <u>My heart is warm for you.</u>
