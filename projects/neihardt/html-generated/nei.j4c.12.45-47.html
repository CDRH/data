      <p>I'm looking forward to receiving the notes, and will get at them as soon as received.
         I'm driven hard + so often I have no vitality for enthusiasm - which explains my silences.
         I will furnish the map &amp; have a picture of Crazy Horse for a frontispiece - a photo
         of him just after he came in to Ft. Robinson.

      <p>My interest in the completion of the Cycle has never decreased. Rather the contrary,
         and it has been hell to keep away from the only thing worth doing. There is, and has
         been, nothing in American Poetry that approaches the Cycle in significance - and Time

         will make this clear. I do hope you can see your way to hook up with Macmillans. Next
         year I'll be on the road part time, pushing the Cycle, and the next of the time at
         home working on it.

      <p>I receive a good many requests for lectures, but am behind. However, will lecture
         3 days in Kansas in Nov - State Teachers' Assn. - Wichita + Topeka.

      <p>How is the Book progressing?</p>

      <p>Educators are coming in 
         <u>strong</u> for the "All-America Movement". There's big money in the idea, if properly handled.
