      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>Your letter telling about your dream experiences with me must have been written at
         about the time when I was writing to you. As you suspected, I was greatly troubled
         and I got up out of bed late at night to talk to you by letter. I did not put into
         my letter anything of my trouble, as I remember; but I was writing to you because
         I wanted to feel near to one who truly knows me.Your experience was undoubtedly a
         matter of confused communication between us. There can be no other explanation. My
         difficulties were not really from the outside. They were due to natural lack of adjustment
         to new circumstances. When I came here I had a constructive dream of a really distinguished
         book department for the P-D. The management here not realizing the type of person
         with which they had to deal has not turned me loose to work out my dream but wishes
         to have me do a daily column of book stuff. This may work out well but it does not
         make me happy. Your dream of fire and tragedy symbolically represented my mood and
         my conception of an unhappy situation. None of this is due to any feeling of unkindness
         on the part of the management. On the contrary both Pulitzer and the Editor-in-Chief
         are very kind indeed and will make all allowances for me in my period of adjustment
         but Oh if they would only let me go ahead with my scheme.
