      <p>Hurrah for the first member of the new Review! I'm all for it + eager to see it. Of
         course, it will take time to make it what you want it to be.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When would you want the stuff on Robinson, and how much?</p>

      <p> comment on the bulk of the Notes, and will go ahead immediately with the edition.
         They gave me a liberal contract on the school edition, + it seems they may do something
         special to push the books in schools. I am ready

         to sacrifice all royalty for a year or two. If they will do something real in the
         way of pushing. I have not made such a proposition, but will at the proper time.

      <p>Signs of any success in St. Louis multiply surprisingly, and I've been hearing gratifying
         gossip from among the P-D force. If I were to stay here, I'd be something of an institution,
         I suppose. Even now, I sometimes seem to be something of the 
         <u>sort.</u>

      <p>Yesterday I was moved into a large luxurious office on the top floor - the 8th - with
         a wide

         view over the city through windows that fill the whole outside of the room. The hall
         outside is all polished marble + I have a chandelier!! Great place to receive ladies,
         who visit one in considerable numbers!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The "movement" thrives. The American Express Co. has made us a flabbergasting offer
         to handle it for us at a good margin of profit to us, + my partner will probably office
         in N.Y. with the Express Co there.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When are you coming over to see me - us? You + Mrs. House both. Make it in warm weather
         + we'll drive all over this beautiful country + sit around + dream dreams.
