<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>Hurrah for the first member of the new Review! I'm all for it + eager to see it. Of course, it will take time to make it what you want it to be.</p>

<p>When would you want the stuff on Robinson, and how much?</p>

<p>Macmillans made <u>no</u> comment on the bulk of the Notes, and will go ahead immediately with the edition. They gave me a liberal contract on the school edition, + it seems they may do something special to push the books in schools. I am ready

to sacrifice all royalty for a year or two. If they will do something real in the way of pushing. I have not made such a proposition, but will at the proper time.</p>

<p>The "movement" thrives. The American Express Co. has made us a flabbergasting offer to handle it for us at a good margin of profit to us, + my partner will probably office in N.Y. with the Express Co there.</p>

<p>When are you coming over to see me - us? You + Mrs. House both. Make it in warm weather + we'll drive all over this beautiful country + sit around + dream dreams.</p>
