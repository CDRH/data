      <p>Bully to hear again from you, &amp; to note that the bad arm hasn't got you down! Evidently
         you are doing well, or else you're a helluva cheerful misrepresenter in this case.
         The letter sounds good.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I've been reading the latest number of P. D. A. L. Excellent again! It's far beyond
         the doubtful stage, surely, and is a continuing achievement. But tell me which "article
         poem or book" aroused the ire of somebody &amp; who the somebody was, if anybody?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wish you were seeing my column daily. Wish you had been seeing it these five years.
         But that's my fault.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Shall be going about May 5-6-7-8. Need the change damnably. If you could be along!</p>
