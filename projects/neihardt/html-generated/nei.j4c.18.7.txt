                <p>Enclosed find proof. Another book on Hitler has just arrived, and I am sending it to you. Please combine these two in one review, and give evaluation of the books at the end.</p>
                
                <p>It's too bad to bother you, but it seems necessary.</p>
                
                <p>The new article should not be over 450 words.</p>
                
                <p>In using the historical present, be sure to make it clear that you are not referring to our moment. There are a lot of doughheads!</p>
                
                <p>Later I'll send you a good novel.</p>
                
                <p>Could you get me this review by the 20th? <u>if</u> not, of course do your best.</p>
