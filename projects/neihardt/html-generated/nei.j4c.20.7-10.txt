                <span class="salute">Dear Dr. Bowen:</span>
                
                
                <p>Good to hear from you! Yes, that poem has had some adventures in its 30 years of life! I've even seen it with other names than mine attached — and feel flattered. One very old man came to think he wrote it himself. A sourdough in Alaska declared it saved his life — etc. etc.</p>

<p>Use the second version.</p>
<p>"Let me <u>lie</u>" must be "Let me 
                    <u>die</u>."</p>
<p>"Soul-house" hyphenated.</p>
<p>"Time-swept" is horrible! Make it "<u>"tune</u>-swept."</p>
                
                <p>Things go very well at the University. My <u>Epic America</u> course continues to be popular and classes grow larger and larger

                    in spite of stiff requirements. I teach two writing courses also. Lots of fun!</p>
                
                <p>It seems I'm to read poetry at the Michigan State College Speech Conference, June 25-26. Perhaps I shall see you.</p>
