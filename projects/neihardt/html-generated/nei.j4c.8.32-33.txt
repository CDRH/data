      <p>I am in accord with the stand you take in your recent letter regarding Miss Harriet
         Monroe and her magazine, 
         <u>POETRY</u>, though the subject does not interest me greatly. It does not interest me greatly
         because I see that the movement represented by Miss Monroe and others is only one
         of many minor symptoms of a universal social disease, the diagnosis of which is a
         matter for the sociologist and economist rather than for the literary critic. My views
         on this subject are suggested in my 
         <u>Laureate Address</u>, where I have undertaken to show that impressionism in the arts is the inevitable
         intellectual reflex of economic individualism. Individualism is doomed because of
         its centrifugal tendency; and all of its symptoms will go with it. It is the course
         of this virulent social disease in the industrial world that interests me, and not
         its comparatively unimportant symptoms in the realm of the arts. Also, I have spent
         too much time in the study of world literature to be greatly excited by the vagaries
         of one silly season. There have been many.

      <p>Miss Monroe has never refused to publish 
         <del class="anything of mine">anything of mine</del> any of my work. The whole number of 
         <u>POETRY</u> for May, 1913, was given to a little drama

         <del class="only one lyric, which appeared in CENTURY.">only one lyric, which appeared in CENTURY.</del> nothing for magazine publication. I am told that at various times Miss Monroe has found occasion to criticise

      <p>Miss Monroe has undoubtedly rendered a valuable service to society, in that she has
         preserved, for ten years, such material as some philosopher of the future will need
         in writing the history of twentieth century illusions.
