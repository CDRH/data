<span class="salute">My dear Miss Teasdale:--</span>


<p>I am very grateful to you for your generous letter written at Rome, and for the copy of "Helen of Troy" which was sent to me from your home.</p>

<p>I hope my second letter did not make me appear too importunate. I was afraid you might not feel at once the sincerity of my motive. I look upon true poets as brothers and sisters, and whenever I can blow a trumpet before any one of them, I am happy to do so. We do not care who does the great work. Perhaps in some inscrutable way we are all the same person.</p>

<p>I love your blank verse poems on great women. Aside from the exquisite quality of the verse and the fine sense for epithets, I am deeply interested in a good woman's outlook upon the great passion. I used to see so differently; but now that I have a wee daughter, I begin to understand.</p>

<p>My wife, who is a sculptor of really remarkable ability, wishes me to send you her congratulations and sisterly greetings. You are of the same age.</p>

<p>Please do not forget to let me have that photograph.</p>

<span class="salute">Sincerely,</span>

<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt

<p>My kindest regards to Miss Rittenhouse if she is still with you.</p>
