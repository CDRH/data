                <p>Surely you are that, and it gave me joy to hear from you.</p>
                
                <p>I've been here as Honnold Lecturer for three weeks — at Knox College — and am completing the series this afternoon. I'll be at home one day, and then Sigurd and I will be off again on a long flight through the West, ending at Christmas. We toured the Old South before I came here.</p>
                
                <p>I've read much of the material you sent me — not all. How you <u>do know</u>, you devoted ones! I'll find a lull on the Western trip and will write more. A-class is waiting for me.</p>
                
                <p>I'm glad you are teaching together again.</p>
