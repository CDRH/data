<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

<p>I'm leaving home tomorrow. Don't know just how far I may go, but shall not be any longer than absolutely necessary. Can do the Mayfield review when I get back.</p>

<p>Don't know that I'll get to your village - don't know anything, thanks to a lazy manager.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. Neihardt

<p>I could make good use of the four extra copies of the address that you say I may have.</p>
