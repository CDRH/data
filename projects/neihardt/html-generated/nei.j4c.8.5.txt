      <p>I'm leaving home tomorrow. Don't know just how far I may go, but shall not be any
         longer than absolutely necessary. Can do the Mayfield review when I get back.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Don't know that I'll get to your village - don't know anything, thanks to a lazy manager.</p>

      <p>I could make good use of the four extra copies of the address that you say I may have.</p>
