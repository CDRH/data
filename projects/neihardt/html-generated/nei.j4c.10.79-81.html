      <p>Many thanks for the generous comment on P.V.! When it is all boiled down, I believe
         there is a residual idea of importance, and one that is certainly  being overlooked.
         For some years, in fact since 1912, I have been reading scientific works as they floated
         in the stream of books, and I have noted the astonishing growth of the mechanistic
         view and the corresponding increase of pessimism and flippancy and cynicism. It is
         now a march of sophistication to hold nothing as good. There is the closest relationship
         between those facts, of course. I am sick of their goddamn twaddle about mechanism.
         It's insane in the larger analysis. They name + classify + think they have eliminated
         mystery; and they have merely ignored mystery. The mellower scientists know this well;
         and I know their views. But the world does 
         <u>not</u> know, and Science is regarded as supreme in our world. 
         <del class=""></del>Why can't they see that their method gets no farther than 
         <del class="to">to</del> that by which a curious man in a sand waste might plot the characteristics and formations,
         forgetting the fact of the mind 
         <del class=""></del>always blowing across the waste?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It's the fashion of the moment, and it's no more. In their rebound

         from superstition they have fallen into a different phase of superstition. The contemporary
         hallucination is in keeping with the whole trend toward animality; and democracy,
         "as is", not the ideal but the fact, is an allied phenomenon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>By God, I'd rather go over to any religious sect than swallow the narrow "scientific"
         view of humanity + the cosmos. But I'll do neither; and in P.V. I have at least suggested
         why I will do 
         <del class=""></del> neither. It is not intelligent to do either.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Say, Comrade, since you are to be in New York, could you not plan to meet Latham as
         my friend + get acquainted? It would no doubt prove to be good for both of us. And
         when your book is ready, you might  be glad for the connection. Let me know and by
         the way, Latham 
         <span class="">[wants?]</span> my short stories to publish + I'll get them ready at once. Proofs of Collected Poems
         should be here now any day.

      <p>If by any miracle, P.V. should gain any special attention, which is highly improbable
         for the very reason that compelled me to write the little book, I can in two months
         produce a book of 
         <u>practical application</u> that would have ten times the power this one may have. Much of it written. It's called
         The 
         <del class=""></del> mood of the moment.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Don't be discouraged! I don't look for any such encouraging reception.</p>
