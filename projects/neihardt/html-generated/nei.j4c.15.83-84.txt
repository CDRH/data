      <p>I've just wired you.</p>
      
      
      <p>The news hit us hard, and our feeling for you and Mary is warm and deep. I am not
         going to juggle hollow words, but I 
         <u>do love you</u>, best and dearest of comrades; and I 
         <u>care</u>. You are not going to be downed by this, I know, for you have great reserves of philosophical
         insight and good sense to draw upon. It is good that you two had a happy trip together
         last fall and that Mrs. House went while still feeling the glow of Morrie's triumph
         and with the happy consciousness of Mary's goodness and beauty.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm wondering when we are going to be together again. We must plan to this end.</p>
