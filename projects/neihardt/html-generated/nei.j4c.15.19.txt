      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn: </div>
      
      
      <p>I am now sure that I can manage to get away during April, at which time I expect to
         visit among the Oglala Sioux for a couple of weeks.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In one of your recent letters you stated that you thought you could arrange engagements
         for me with the other State normals. If you could do this without too much trouble,
         I should be glad to have you go ahead. As to the dates, any time in April or early
         May would be satisfactory to me. I plan to drive through and should want to have enough
         time  between engagements to use my car for transportation. This would not take much
         longer than travel by train.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It will surely be a pleasure to be back at Wayne again with you.</p>
      
      
      <p>I believe that the contract for the Indian book, which I have signed with William
         Morrow and Company, will make it possible for me to go ahead with my main work after
         this summer.
      </p>
