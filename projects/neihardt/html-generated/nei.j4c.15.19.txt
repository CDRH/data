                <span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>
                
                <p>I am now sure that I can manage to get away during April, at which time I expect to visit among the Oglala Sioux for a couple of weeks.</p>
                
                <p>In one of your recent letters you stated that you thought you could arrange engagements for me with the other State normals. If you could do this without too much trouble, I should be glad to have you go ahead. As to the dates, any time in April or early May would be satisfactory to me. I plan to drive through and should want to have enough time  between engagements to use my car for transportation. This would not take much longer than travel by train.</p>
                
                <p>It will surely be a pleasure to be back at Wayne again with you.</p>
                
                <p>I believe that the contract for the Indian book, which I have signed with William Morrow and Company, will make it possible for me to go ahead with my main work after this summer.</p>
