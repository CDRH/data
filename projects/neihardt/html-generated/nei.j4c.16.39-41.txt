      <p>I'm on another trip and have been travelling fast. Am a bit weary, of course; but
         not too much so, as you can see, to write you. How I wish it could be talk &amp; not writing,
         for I want to feel you close again. I have had some unusual distractions, which account
         for my neglect of the book. I'm ready to believe its bully &amp; a casual examination
         yields many fine promises.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When I get back in November from this trip, I'll plunge in &amp; read the book carefully
         if I'm not wiped out by 14 engagements &amp; much travel. Of course, I'll not be wiped
         out.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Comrade, The Song of the Messiah </p>

      </p>
      <p> beautiful &amp; good.

         I have a mind to dedicate it to you! (How about this?) For there is a deep goodness
         in you that has meant so much to me and shall continue to mean much.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The American Scholar (Phi Beta Kappa official magazine, 
         <u>very select</u>) has been asking to publish some of the Messiah, saying that Dr. Canby urged it.
         Why? I don't know. I'm not interested at all.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Comrade, after the 
         <u>Messiah</u> 
         only. 
         <u>Jed Smith</u> will remain to be written &amp; then my dream will have been materialized. It will all
         come true, I know. I do wish you could be happy. But you are a fine spirit, &amp; they
         feel too much.
