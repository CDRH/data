      <p>Here's the bibliography. I have given only the books. It would be a deuce of a job
         to run down all the stories and poems that appeared in various 
         <del class=""></del> magazines between 1900 and 190
         <del class=""></del>8 when I quit
         <del class=""></del> writing stories and lyrics and settled down to the epic cycle. At one time (1907
         and '08) my short stories were in great demand, and there were quite a number of them.
         I'll leave the complete story of the earlier period to be worked out by some chap
         lucky enough to outlive me.

      <p>You have doubtless received the supplementary matter I sent — ? The Niehardt Club
         will issue a Face Bulletin, which will doubtless contain a notice of the publication
         of the Laureate address. Perhaps you might care to send copy to Dr. J.T. House, Wayne,
         Nebraska. He's a Bookfellow, you know.
