      <p>I am hurrying this news to you because I know it will make your face glow in the way
         I like to remember when I'm blue.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have just received a long night letter from Curtis Hidden Page, President of the
         Poetry Society of America, inviting me to be the honor guest of the Society for a
         whole week, beginning Sat. Jan. 26th. Am to speak at least once daily and sometimes
         twice, before different bodies, and Leonora Speyer (an arbitress of fashion!) will
         give a reception in my honor as a crowning event. The latter, I understand, at the
         Biltmore. This looks as though the most powerful literary gang in America wants to
         let me inside.

      <p>The idea is that I give "a complete exposition of my work".</p>
