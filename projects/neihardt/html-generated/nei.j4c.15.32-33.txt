                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
            
                <p>Bullier and bullier! The latest number is especially good, I think. I'm more than pleased with the editorial stuff, and was particularly impressed by the Oklahoma reminiscence. That's a good job in a good vein.</p>
                
                <p>I'd like to see you free to do as you suggest in your letter. Perhaps it will be so. <span class="unclear ">[Not at?]</span> all impossible. I myself might conceivably be in position to put it over.</p>
                
                <p>More of the sort of indicators I mentioned to you as coming regularly have turned up this week &amp; last. Joseph Alexander writes Hilda that her dad is one of the "greatest" ever. Frank Nudescher, the painter, in conversation with a P-D man, said "the greatest America had ever produced". A man in Ohio, <del/> is, he says, raising his boy on my fodder. Etc. It goes on like that, and there are no more things from one part of the country than another.</p>
                
                <p>You really can't suppose I tell you a <span class="unclear ">[part?]</span> of this stuff through vanity &amp; that sort of thing. I tell you <del/> so that you may feel more <del/> support for your enthusiasm, which <del/> means so much to me &amp; which I would certainly discourage if I did not know — and I know — that <del/> you will be honored for it when neither of us shall any longer care.</p>
                
                <p>You should visit here. When?</p>
