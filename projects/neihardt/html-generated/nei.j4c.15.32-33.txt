      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>Bullier and bullier! The latest number is especially good, I think. I'm more than
         pleased with the editorial stuff, and was particularly impressed by the Oklahoma reminiscence.
         That's a good job in a good vein.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'd like to see you free to do as you suggest in your letter. Perhaps it will be so.
         
         <span class="">[Not at?]</span> all impossible. I myself might conceivably be in position to put it over.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>More of the sort of indicators I mentioned to you as coming regularly have turned
         up this week &amp; last. Joseph Alexander writes Hilda that her dad is one of the "greatest"
         ever. Frank Nudescher, the painter, in conversation with a P-D man, said "the greatest
         America had ever produced". A man in Ohio, 
         <del class=""></del> is, he says, raising his boy on my fodder. Etc. It goes on like that, and there are
         no more things from one part of the country than another.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You really can't suppose I tell you a 
         <span class="">[part?]</span> of this stuff through vanity &amp; that sort of thing. I tell you 
         <del class=""></del> so that you may feel more 
         <del class=""></del> support for your enthusiasm, which 
         <del class=""></del> means so much to me &amp; which I would certainly discourage if I did not know — and
         I know — that 
         <del class=""></del> you will be honored for it when neither of us shall any longer care.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You should visit here. When?</p>
