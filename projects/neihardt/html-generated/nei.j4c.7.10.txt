<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>


<p>Enclosed find a dollar bill, for which please enter Judge Vinzenhaler, Branson, Mo., as a member of the Order of Bookfellows. I have not his initials and am not quite certain that my spelling of his name is correct. You will get these details from him.</p>

<div class="note">He is 1070</div>

<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Yours always,</span>

<br/>Jno. N.
</span>

<p>Many thanks for your kind letter received day before yesterday. If I come to Chicago, I'll certainly find you and Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<div class="note">Its good to know that you will issue something more by Cabell. I'm strong for him. Have just read "Beyond Life".</div>
