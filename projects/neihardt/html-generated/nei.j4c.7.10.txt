      <p>Enclosed find a dollar bill, for which please enter Judge Vinzenhaler, Branson, Mo.,
         as a member of the Order of Bookfellows. I have not his initials and am not quite
         certain that my spelling of his name is correct. You will get these details from him.

      <p>Many thanks for your kind letter received day before yesterday. If I come to Chicago,
         I'll certainly find you and Mrs. Seymour.
