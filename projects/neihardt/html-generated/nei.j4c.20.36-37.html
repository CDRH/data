      <p>That was another bully letter, and it gave me joy as usual. I feel about you as you
         feel about me, and I am deeply grateful that I found you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Everything goes well here. We've been having rains, and the grass is happy. Crops
         are flourishing too, of course — oats and soy beans. There are seven fine colts romping
         around here now — beautiful things and all most promising. Our Hackney mare's colt
         is a dream of the ideal horse come true, and the cross-breds (American Saddle-Hackney)
         have all the desired points. The pure Saddle Breds are tops too. They have all that
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>colts</u>
      </p>
      <p> can show. Next they must show that they have that special spark that makes the great
         show horse. It's like genius in men, and cannot be predicted. But, at least, they're
         all going to be lovely

         horses, well worth raising &amp; training. Still, it is the "extra something" horse we're
         hoping one of them may be.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This has been an especially good year at the University, somehow. My big 
         <u>Epic America</u> class gave me a rousing ovation when I ended the course &amp; said goodbye. Bless their
         hearts! My Critical Essay class threw a picnic out here at the farm, &amp; we ended the
         evening in the prayer garden. They are all older students — two with families — one
         42 years old and retired from the Coast Guard. Mature minds! Most interesting!

      <p>The Alumnus Magazine this month is devoted largely to J. G. N. You'll see a copy.
         Also, an article in the National Speech Journal (on second thought, I enclose the
         latter). Your dear Lady is with you now, bless her too. I like to think of her.
