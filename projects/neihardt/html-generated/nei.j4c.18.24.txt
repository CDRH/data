                <span class="salute">Dear Friends:</span>
                
                <p>I'm <u>more</u> than pleased with the devoted, thorough manner in which you are doing the study of my work. Be sure I'm deeply grateful.</p>
                
                <p>As for "verifying quotations", I meant to make sure that passages from my poetry are correctly quoted. I noted a few errors in quotations.</p>
                
                <p>I am familiar with Stuart's journal edited by my friend, Rollins, which establishes the fact that Stuart crossed the Divide through or near South Pass in 1811. He was bound eastward. But his discovery had been utterly forgotten and had no effect whatever on history. The Ashley-Henry men made the effective discovery that resulted in the opening of the trail to the Pacific.</p>
                
                <p>The Sublette matter is of slight importance; but it <u>does</u> seem to have been William who made the first wagon trip. I'll send the book as soon as I can find it in our uncatalogued library. I'm getting on with "Jed Smith". There are difficult problems of strategy, but I'm coming through and am happy.</p> 
<div class="note">I think there will be no difficulty in arranging with Macmillans when they know the project is not for profit.</div>
