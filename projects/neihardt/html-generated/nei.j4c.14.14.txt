      <p>My idea, with reference to the Horace translations, was to have this man, who has spent something like twenty-five or thirty years on the subject, to write an article showing how many of Horaces poems apply to our own day as well
         as to his, and I thought the man's own translations could be used in this article.
         I am sorry that he sent you only two or three translations clipped from some paper.
         My feeling about his work as a translator is based on a big manuscript containing
         all the poems of Horace that he gave me to read, and though the man is certainly no poet, there is a certain earnestness and fidelity
         in his work that will bear examination. If the fellow can write as well as he should,
         for he seems to be rather scholarly, I should think he might do something interesting
         for you.
