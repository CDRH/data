<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>My idea, with reference to the Horace translations, was to have this man, who has spent something like twenty-five or thirty years on the subject, to write an article showing how many of Horaces poems apply to our own day as well as to his, and I thought the man's own translations could be used in this article. I am sorry that he sent you only two or three translations clipped from some paper. My feeling about his work as a translator is based on a big manuscript containing all the poems of Horace that he gave me to read, and though the man is certainly no poet, there is a certain earnestness and fidelity in his work that will bear examination. If the fellow can write as well as he should, for he seems to be rather scholarly, I should think he might do something interesting for you.</p>

<br/>Jno.
