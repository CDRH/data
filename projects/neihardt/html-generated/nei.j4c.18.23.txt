      <p>It has just struck me that Neihardt Hall at Wayne should be mentioned under "Honors".
         That's a very fine monument!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Also, you might want to say that the  bell I 
         <u>used</u> to ring is now mounted on a stone base on the campus, and that when it was dedicated,
         my daughter, Hilda, then a student, unveiled the monument and rang the bell. Makes
         a pretty story, I think!

      <p>Bancroft, some years ago, made a record of all the places where I lived there and
         recorded it at the county seat, West Point. The same was done at Wayne.
