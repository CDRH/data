      <p>
         <u>Are</u> you sick? I'm really worried. I have not learned yet whether or not you have received
         
         <u>Black Elk</u>, and I wouldn't have you think I'd neglect you of 
         <u>all</u> the people in the world. I ordered one sent to you to save time, &amp; upon hearing from
         you intended to send the usual autograph copy for your own.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Everything looks promising here. 
         <u>Messiah</u> moves on &amp; I'm afraid it's beautiful, with a great sad glory ahead.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Wish I could see you. Am hoping to have a month or so on the high prairies this spring
         
         <del class=""></del>or summer, or both.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>N. Y. Times will have a fine illustrated article tomorrow (the 6th). Saw advance copy
         of it. John Chamberlain wrote it &amp; did a good job. I've encountered some meanness
         &amp; a bit of green eye so far, but that's expected. Also, much ignorance playing temporary
         Indian expert; but that is only a matter of pathetic necessity! The poor guys have
         to live. 
         <div class="note">(Some 
            <u>strong</u> reviews too.) On the whole am quite satisfied.
