      <p>I've been 
         <u>very</u> lazy, deliberately so, for nearly 3 wks. I will drive back to St. Louis Friday.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
         <em>Yes</em>
      </p>
      <p>, you are right. You will write a fine book about the whirl called Neihardt + the
         work. Also, nothing can stop this thing. The work will last beyond all but a very
         few things of our generation. This delay is essential, and will lead to

      <p>
         greater things as you will see later.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have signed for year after next with the Affiliated Lyceums of Cleveland. Am now
         about to become national director of a new + very promising scheme. (I plan to work
         you in. Shall wait for more definite developments before writing you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You </p>
      <p>
         <u>must</u>
      </p>
      <p> be with Macmillans, if possible. But a year or two or three may bring out better
         ways

      <p>
         <u>Wars!</u>
      </p>
      <p> Make them copious enough to be fairly fool-proof with crude teachers. Ask me any
         questions and I'll reply at once.
