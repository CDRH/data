      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. McAdams: </div>
      
      
      <p>It was impossible to get another leader to you Friday 
         <del class="yesterday">yesterday</del> morning. This did not occur to me while we were talking on the 'phone Thursday afternoon.
         I hope it will be possible to use the enclosed this week. I know Gottlieb will see
         that the proof is correct.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm really sorry that the Masters article seems objectionable, but I'm sure you have
         good reasons. Never was a time more thoroughly bedevelled with 
         <del class=""></del>false 
         <del class="false">false</del> prophets in all fields, and it seems worthwhile to help a little, whenever possible, to discredit them.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was serious about your dropping in here and being around with us. You'd like it,
         I hope, and we would, I know.
      </p>
