      <p>Lyndal has heard the story of Mr. Stork and the Pickle Fork five times, and would
         have heard it more but for the fact that we've been having flu for a week. She says
         for me to say to you: "Many thanks for the story. I like it very much, and I think
         it pays to be polite."

      <p>It </p>
      <p>
         <u>is</u>
      </p>
      <p> a good yarn. We have not yet been able to read "The Holy Earth", but we are coming
         out
