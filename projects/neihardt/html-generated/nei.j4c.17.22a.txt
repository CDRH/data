      <p>Since 
         <del class="[my?] letter">my letter</del> writing you on July 24th I have 
         <del class=""></del> read a copy of Dr. Sealock's letter 
         <del class=""></del> to you 
         <span class="">[?]</span> July 5th. I can not but feel more strongly than when I wrote to you that there should
         be some means of getting this letter before the public. I understand, of course, that
         no newspaper or news agency could run the risk; but 
         <del class="you as Senator,">you as Senator,</del>
         
         is there any good reason why the letter could not be read into the Congressional Record.
         
         <del class="[Once?]">Once</del> Certainly the number containing the letter would be popular reading in Nebraska,
         at least, and 
         <del class="I know">I know</del> I know of 
         <del class="several">several</del>some 
         powerful newspapers that would be grateful for the opportunity to quote.
