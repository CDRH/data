                <p>Since <del><span class="unclear ">[my?]</span> letter</del> writing you on July 24th I have <del/> read a copy of Dr. Sealock's letter <del/> to you <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> July 5th. I can not but feel more strongly than when I wrote to you that there should be some means of getting this letter before the public. I understand, of course, that no newspaper or news agency could run the risk; but <del>you as Senator,</del>
                    
                    is there any good reason why the letter could not be read into the Congressional Record. <del><span class="unclear ">[Once?]</span></del> Certainly the number containing the letter would be popular reading in Nebraska, at least, and <del>I know</del> I know of <del>several</del>some 
                    powerful newspapers that would be grateful for the opportunity to quote.</p>
