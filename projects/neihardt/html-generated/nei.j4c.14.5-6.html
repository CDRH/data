      <p>I have become well acquainted with a Philippine poet, 
         <u>M. de Gracia Concepion</u>, who is now on his way to Manilla. Yesterday I asked him to do an article for you
         on Philippine poetry, giving a number of representative things to be published therewith.
         He was eager to do it, and no doubt he has written you, as he promised to do. This
         should make a rather good feature, I should think. Of course, I told him there's no
         payment, and he was glad to throw in with your sort of magazine.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I must send that article on Tolerance this week end.</p>
