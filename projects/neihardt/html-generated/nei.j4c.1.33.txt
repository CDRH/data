<span class="salute">Dear Davis:—</span>


	<p>I have been intending to tell you how bully I think
the decorations of "Man-Song" are! You ought to congratulate
the artist for me. He got right into the lines.</p>
	<p>Davis, on July first I start on my three thousand mile
canoe trip down the Missouri. Will use a four horse power
canoe; start at Fort Benton, Mont., and go to St. Louis.
Can't you drop me a line at Fort Benton, wishing me luck?
I'll be there until the tenth.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Ever yours,</span>
<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
