      <p>I have been intending to tell you how bully I think
         the decorations of "Man-Song" are! You ought to congratulate
         the artist for me. He got right into the lines.

      <p>Davis, on July first I start on my three thousand mile
         canoe trip down the Missouri. Will use a four horse power
         canoe; start at Fort Benton, Mont., and go to St. Louis.
         Can't you drop me a line at Fort Benton, wishing me luck?
         I'll be there until the tenth.
      </p>
