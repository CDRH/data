      <p>I was sorry to fail you in the matter of the quatrain; but I have no heart of that
         sort of thing, however I may admire good things of the sort when done by others. I
         hope my message reached you while Markham was still in the house. It was timed to
         arrive during the tea-flight.

      <p>Mrs. Markham sends us her notice to let you have our volumes of poetry for 1921 for
         use in judging the best book of poems of the year. I think they have already been
         sent her and you too. The Poet's Pack is out of the running, I fancy, as it is for
         single poets. 
         <u>Candles in the Sun</u>, by William Griffith, and our brochure 
         <u>In Gossamer Grey,</u> by Oscar Williams, are, I think, the only ones we have to enter in the competition.
         I think they are already in your group for consideration, but if not of course I'll
         be glad to send them.
      </p>
