      <p>Many thanks for your kindly letter of the 16th.</p>
      
      
      <p>I must tell you exactly what moved me to write you, so that there may be no misapprehension.
         A Mr. E. E. Holm and his wife, superintendent and principal, respectively, at Ruskin,
         have been devoted friends of my work and me for many years. During a recent visit
         to Lincoln, Mr. Holm was talking about me to Dr. Wimberly of the University, and in
         the conversation Mr. Holm mentioned the rumor he had heard. (Where he heard it, I
         do not know.) Whereupon, Dr. Wimberly, I understand, said quite casually: "If it's
         true, I wonder if Neihardt might be interested." Holm then wrote me and suggested
         that, if the idea interested me, I might write for information to my old friend and
         neighbor of Bancroft, Hon. Allen G. Burke. I did write to Mr. Burke, for I feel very
         close to him; but before I received a reply, it seemed to me that I should have written
         directly to you, for I have never been a scheming person working
         
      </p>

         under cover. No one suggested that I write to you. I was prompted to do so by my own
         feeling of respect for you and for myself.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A delayed reply from Mr. Burke seems to indicate that no such rumor is current in
         Lincoln. I have not heard from Dr. Wimberly, whose relation to the matter was merely
         casual.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It's all petty enough, but I'm not sorry I wrote you; for my letter brought a kindly
         note from you and a copy of the Brown Shingles brochure, which my wife and I cherish.
         We too have built a home with much living and loving; and the birds are happy in our
         secret garden where they come to drink at the fountain. We know what Brown Shingles
         must mean to you and your daughter—especially now that it is sanctified by the silent
         presence of the Lady of the Birds.
      </p>
