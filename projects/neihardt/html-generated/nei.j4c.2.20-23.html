      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling:— </div>
      
      
      <p>I appreciate that letter of yours written when you were far from happy. I can imagine
         the situation. But don't worry, old man. Everything is grist for the mills of the

      <p> gods. I feel for both of you, instinctively, marriage can be hell, and separation
         is a brutal sort of spiritual surgery. There's no solution for such problems, it seems.
         It's too bad we can't fit into each other better. Men + women never really get acquainted.
         Strange antagonism made the more terrible with what we call affection. Women are a
         queer breed; men are a queer breed — and

         poets, I fancy, are queerer still. Don't stew, old man.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Thanks for the poem — a curious, moody thing, and beautiful, of course.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'll write 
         <span class="">[Lindsay?]</span> on the 10th, as you suggest. Very glad for the chance to know him.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When you go on that world — 
         <span class="">[though?]</span>, don't forget me. Come this way, if possible.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I want to make a confession &amp; ask a favor. The confession: I gave away my copy of
         that terrific sonnet, "The Theriot of Satan". A friend, to whom I was deeply indebted,
         asked for it. A copy wouldn't do. The favor: won't you write me out another — sign
         it?

      <p>When I get farther along with the "Song of Hugh Glass" I'll give you a copy if you
         want it. Have 500 lines now — and I believe I'm succeeding. There will be about 1500,
         and yet the thing is closely wrought. It's a big story, worth elaborating. I'm doing
         the thing simply &amp; it flows.

      <p>Did you know Cawein gave Miss 
         <span class="">[Moural?]</span> &amp; her fat donkey a gentle drubbing? He did. She sent me the letter last Spring!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Say, The Boston Poetry journal ought to live, because it stands for the real thing
         as much it can. 
         <span class="">[Braithwaite?]</span> tells me he's having hard sledding with it — at least he suggests as much.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>So long for the moment. Luck to you! Big Brother!</p>
