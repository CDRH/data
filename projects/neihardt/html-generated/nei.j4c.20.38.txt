                <p>I've just received the copy of your McCurdy letter. Since H. S. Latham left Macmillans about two years ago I have had no close contact with anyone in the company. There have been two or three successors to Latham. The present Editor-in-Chief is R. F. De Wilton. I've had some contact with him, but he means nothing much to me. On the off chance that he may prove

                    helpful, I'm enclosing a note of introduction.</p>
                    <ul><li>1. Letters to Latham over many years</li><li>2. Letters to his predecessor as Ed.-in-Chief, whose name I have forgotten.</li></ul>
                   <p>These would be of general value.</p>
                
                <p>Do see Herman Hagedorm at the old Theo. <del>Rose</del> Roosevelt house. He, I'm sure, could help you with introductions.</p>
                
                <p>Good hunting!</p>
