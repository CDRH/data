<span class="salute">My dear Mr. Davis:—</span>


	<p>Your letter of late date concerning the wolf story 
has done me more good than all the other letters I have
ever received. It was a whole-souled man who wrote that!
I would rather have a man say that I "can write like the
devil" than to have him rank me in academic phrases with
the masters. It's the language of real men — men who have
blood in them and eat beefsteaks. You can't know how
much that sentence encourages me!</p>

<p><u>I would take in washing for you!</u></p>

	<p>Sometime when I get a book good enough, I am going to
ask your permission to dedicate it to you: for if I ever
succeed, I will remember you as my best encourager. Your
brickbats have made me respect you.</p>

	<p>I will gladly undertake the changing of the wolf tale,
and will drown the litter as soon as they get back from
New York. I have a plan already made which will make the tale
about as good as before. I did like those pups, though.</p>

	<p>I want to thank you again for your letter.</p>

<span class="salute">Very sincerely yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
