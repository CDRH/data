      <div class="salute">My dear Mr. Davis:— </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>Your letter of late date concerning the wolf story 
         has done me more good than all the other letters I have
         ever received. It was a whole-souled man who wrote that!
         I would rather have a man say that I "can write like the
         devil" than to have him rank me in academic phrases with
         the masters. It's the language of real men — men who have
         blood in them and eat beefsteaks. You can't know how
         much that sentence encourages me!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
         <u>I would take in washing for you!</u>
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>Sometime when I get a book good enough, I am going to
         ask your permission to dedicate it to you: for if I ever
         succeed, I will remember you as my best encourager. Your
         brickbats have made me respect you.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>I will gladly undertake the changing of the wolf tale,
         and will drown the litter as soon as they get back from
         New York. I have a plan already made which will make the tale
         about as good as before. I did like those pups, though.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>I want to thank you again for your letter.</p>
