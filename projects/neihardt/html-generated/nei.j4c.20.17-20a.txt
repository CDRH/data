      <p>That was a precious letter — bless your warm heart!</p>
      
      
      <p>It is good to hear about your children — all of them fine young people, and going
         places, "high-hearted with a hunger for the new". I feel deeply all you 
         
         <u>say</u> of them, and 
         <u>what can</u> 
         <em>not</em> 
         <u>be said</u> even more. How very worthwhile it all is!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Things go well here, as usual. Nice, spangly Xmas with five (5) grandchildren to furnish
         the enthusiasm and sense of wonder. We do not think of

      <p>Alice's horse business is growing rapidly. She has a riding school, as you may know.
         It is well patronized, but the horse raising and training is more important in the
         long run. She has 12 horses of her own and is boarding and training several others
         — with the help of Mr. "Dick" Cook of Stephens College. He is

         has several really fine horses, and Mona &amp; I have one. Really top horses, some of
         them, with the very best bloodlines. Also, Mona &amp; I have four ponies — two of them
         mares with foal. We expect some beautiful colts in the spring.
