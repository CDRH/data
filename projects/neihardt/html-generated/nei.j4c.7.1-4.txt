      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>Your letter reached me at Sioux Falls, S.D., after going to Bancroft, Nebr., and Branson,
         Mo. Since writing you last I have moved away from Nebraska and am now located on Lake
         Taneycomo in the Ozark Mountains of So. Missouri. It's a very beautiful place and
         the climate is wonderful. at the present moment the grass is as green as a relative's
         eye, and the butter we make is golden. It's a lazy place, and few people seem to be
         "on the make". I have bought four acres and a rather large house on top of a hill
         500 feet above the lake. Such a view, and such a dear place in which to live and be
         one's best!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Branson has 1100 population &amp; during the summer 50,000 people come here. We are certainly
         not out of the world. Our home is within a minute's walk of virgin woods, and yet
         we have electricity for light &amp; power and our supplies are delivered at the house.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have just come home from a three weeks lecture trip through the north. Will be going
         out again toward the end of February, &amp; will get as far west as Spokane.

         I do wish I could get down there to see you, but doubt if I can make it. I like you,
         Geo. Sterling! Maybe that isn't thrilling to you, but it is to me.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You were very good to take my quibbling about the drama without ill feeling. There
         is no question as to your power or your expression of it. I merely raise a fundamental
         question as to your characteristic attitude toward human nature. You realized that,
         didn't you? Sterling, Old Man, you're wrong about human nature. It 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>is</u>
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>essentially</u>
      </p>
      <p> noble. I said to my wife last night: If Sterling were on a sailing ship, he'd be
         a hero. I can see you disproving your own theory regarding fundamental human nature.
         So much for you. As for others, an insane economic system is to blame for nearly all
         damnable meanness. Up in the the Dakotas I found it horrible to set a grip down any
         place without fear of having it stolen. In Omaha &amp; Kansas City one must actually keep
         his hands on his baggage if he doesn't want it stolen. The economic pressure in the
         cities turns the human animal into all sorts of beasts. In a clean uncrowded country
         the same human nature is trustworthy.

      <p>
         <u>Too</u>
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>much</u>
      </p>
      <p> at one end and </p>
      <p>
         <u>too</u>
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>little</u>
      </p>
      <p> on the other — that is the cause of most distortions of human nature. In great tragic
         moments, involving the lives of men &amp; women, a large percentage of men &amp; women will
         prove their essential nobility. All the sickly hellishness that is expressed in jazz
         can be traced directly back to an economic situation. (I am merely suggesting, not
         trying to prove anything — I mean, I'm not trying to prove anything conclusive. We've
         got to smash individualism Sterling; because individualism is producing an inferior
         type of man.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I say these things not because I have no knowledge of men &amp; women, Old Man. I know
         the animal &amp; have done about everything anybody else has done in the way of hell-raising
         &amp; general oneriness. I was raised on the raw edge of things, and I know a lot about
         inhumanity &amp; slow torture. But I am able now to see why men become so. We must kill
         this insane economic individualism, and then men will prove my contention as to essential
         nobility.

      <p>My history, "The Splendid Wayfaring" came out in November. My "Two Mothers"(verse
         dramas) is due now. You'll

      <p>When I read before the University 
         <span class="notscanned">[?]</span> in Omaha, the affair was turned into a business meeting, &amp; a "Neihardt 
         <span class="notscanned">[?]</span> Club" was organized for propaganda purposes. The members are prominent 
         <u>business</u> men of the city, &amp; the president is principal of Central High School. Pretty good
         for a roughneck town, isn't it?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm told that the present legislature of Nebraska is about to make me "Laureate of
         Nebraska &amp; The Prairies" by joint resolution. They tell me that a number of delegations
         are strong for it, &amp; that the Governor favors the movement. Now, of course, I see
         how funny this could be; but there's evidently some affection in it, &amp; I can't feel
         funny about any expression of affection.

      <p>Mrs. Trine is working in Los Angeles to get "Glass" into the "Movies", &amp; Braithwaite
         in Boston seems very hopeful as to the possibilities back there.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>This is my news. </p>
      
      
      <p>Luck to you in 
         <del class=""></del> everything, Sterling!
