      <p>I mailed you a letter yesterday (Sunday), which should convince you that everything
         is absolutely all right between us and has been.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am writing this note to make myself feel sure that you will hear from me, since
         the letter of yesterday might possibly miscarry.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I hope you will be so much interested in planning for your great and worthy adventure
         that you will not have any room in your mind for unhappiness, or, at most, for very
         little.
      </p>
