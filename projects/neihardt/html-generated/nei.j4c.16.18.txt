      <p>The bank holiday began before I could cash the P-D check of March 4th. I now have
         two P-D checks. It is doubtful if our local bank will open soon; but I note that 
         <del class=""></del> certain St. Louis banks may open on Monday, the 13th. 
         <del class="I am wondering if I could [?] return the two checks to you could yo">I am wondering if I could  return the two checks to you could yo</del>If I should return the two checks to you, could you send me currency for them? So
         far I have
