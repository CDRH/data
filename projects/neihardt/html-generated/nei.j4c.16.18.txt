It is doubtful if our local bank will open soon; but I note that <del/> certain St. Louis banks may open on Monday, the 13th. <del>I am wondering if I could <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> return the two checks to you could yo</del>If I should return the two checks to you, could you send me currency for them? So far I have <del>been in</del> been in no way <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>, but no doubt cash will come in handy soon.</p>
