      <p>Please do not let the "Address" go to press until corrected proof has been received
         from me. There are a number of rather bad errors, and I want to add a paragraph. I
         wish you had sent duplicate proofs. As it is I absolutely have to keep the one you
         sent me.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I told you the other day to send proof to Moscow Idaho; but I think now it would be
         much better to send to me % Whitman College, Walla Walla, Wash. I'll be there on Nov.
         28.
      </p>
