<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>


<p>Please do not let the "Address" go to press until corrected proof has been received from me. There are a number of rather bad errors, and I want to add a paragraph. I wish you had sent duplicate proofs. As it is I absolutely have to keep the one you sent me.</p>

<p>I told you the other day to send proof to Moscow Idaho; but I think now it would be much better to send to me % Whitman College, Walla Walla, Wash. I'll be there on Nov. 28.</p>

<span class="salute">Yours always</span>
<br/>Jno G. Neihardt
