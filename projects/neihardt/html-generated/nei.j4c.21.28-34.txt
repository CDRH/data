      <div class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly: </div>
      
      
      <p>That 
         <u>was</u> a good letter — yours of the 9th received only yesterday. (It's a long way out there!)
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You certainly hit the bull's eye when you pointed out that my world-view is 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>both</u>
      </p>
      <p> Aristotelian and Platonic. That is why I wrote 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Poetic Values</u>
      </p>
      <p> — to show that there is </p>
      <p>
         <u>no gap between the two</u>
      </p>
      <p>, that our scale of values
         
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">-2-</h6>
      <p>
         
         is continuous. All our values, from "lowest" to "highest" — from common sense through
         science and on through the esthetic, the ethical, the religious values 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>are obviously</u>
      </p>
      <p> creations in consciousness from selected data of our experience. It is commonly assumed,
         without examination of that assumption, that our 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>sense values</u>
      </p>
      <p> are "objective" and therefore "real". But they are created in consciousness too.	
         
         
      </p>
      <p>

      <h6 class="fw">-3-</h6>
      <p>
         
         Surely, nothing in the "sense world" is essentially as we conceive it. The 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>physicists back us 100% in this view</u>
      </p>
      <p>, as I showed 36 years ago in </p>
      <p>
         <u>Poetic Values</u>
      </p>
      <p>; and since then they have become more and more obviously supporters of that view.
         In brief, this is what happens, as I've set forth in 
      </p>

         <u>Poetic Values</u>

      <p>I will read the Poetics and comment modestly, I hope, in keeping with my own experience

         Indeed, I know the inside of it very well. Also, I have often found the way out 
         <u>through</u> the 
         <u>poetic miracle</u> and also prayer. 
         <u>Poetic Values</u> explains this also.
