                <p>I was away from home when your letter arrived, and because Mona expected me back any day, she held the letter. I do wish we could have met, for Mona and I do sincerely cherish your friendship. This puts the feeling inadequately.</p>
                
                <p>I'll be so glad if you like <u>Jed</u>. Curiously enough, the general opinion seems to be that it's my top. I doubt that, but there is a simplicity I've not shown in the others.</p>
                
                <p>In <u>Jed</u> the <u>Other</u> is constantly breaking through the dense medium of this world. In <u>The Song of the Messiah</u>, the dense medium fades out, and <u>nothing</u> is left but the abiding reality. Some have actually seen this by themselves.</p>
                
                <p>Some fine things have been said of the whole Cycle - the best I've seen being in the Washington ( D. C. ) Post of Oct. 26th. I have not subscribed to a press-clipping

                <p>There's more in me I'd be happy to do, if I'm allowed by circumstances to do more. And it's rich stuff. Perhaps I'll have the privilege; but this is a pitiable world, truly.</p>
