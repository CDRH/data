      <p>I have read "Ideal Passion" a number of times, brooding over it; and I want to thank
         you for that glorious experience. I also worship your Lady — wistfully and at a distance.

      <p>THERE is good reason to suspect that, when our generation shall have passed away,
         the modest little volume before us will be prized by book collectors; for its author
         undoubtedly deserves to be called the High Priest of American literature, and the
         sequence of 52 sonnets here presented is, in our opinion, the finest flower of the
         man's genius.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Petrarch immortalized his Laura, Dante his Beatrice, and many lesser bards have celebrated
         the charms of their ladies, thereby greatly enriching literature. But it is no mortal
         mistress that Woodberry praises.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            	
            <p>"I know not who thou art to whom I pray,
               	Or that indeed thou art apart from me.
            </p>
            
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      	
      <p>His mistress is no other than the Ideal of Universal Beauty as revealed in cosmic
         and human relations.
      </p>

         <div class="l">—in a flying marble fold </div>
         
         <div class="l">Of Helias once I saw eternity </div>
         
         <div class="l">Flutter about her form; all nature she </div>
         
         <div class="l">Inspirits; but round her being there is rolled </div>
         
         <div class="l">The inextinguisable beauty old </div>
         
         <div class="l">Of the far shining mountains and the sea. </div>
          
      </div>
      	
      <p>He does not envy Plutarch and Dante their loves, for</p>
      
      <div class="lg">
         	
         <div class="l">"Though glorified, their love was human 
            	love; 
         </div>
         	
         <div class="l">One unto one. A greater love I know." </div>
          
      </div>
      	
      <p>He can not look anywhere but he sees the face of his lady; "in Art's still dream or
         where earth's roses burn" and all the grief and joy and aspiration of the race through
         countless generations have made the  beauty of her face.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Those who are familiar with Mr. Woodberry's essays (and they are perhaps the greatest
         essays in American literature) will note that in this sequence the man has once more
         delivered his own peculiar message in a sublimated form. For over and over, both in
         his prose and in his verse, he emphasizes the importance of cherising the Racial Memory-that
         complex of human experience which constitutes our supreme inheritance, and which,
         when fully realized, makes of life a shining adventure and of earth a holy place.
      </p>
      	
      <p>The idea is far more than a poet's whimsy; it is the very essence of education itself,
         although our world, gone mad with the lust of material things, temporarily has forgotten
         the fact. To this idea Mr. Woodberry's life has been dedicated, and it is therefore
         with the utmost sincerity that he has written the strangely beautiful closing lines
         of his sequence:
      </p>
      
      <div class="lg">
         	
         <div class="l">Oh, unto my frail state may she yet lead </div>
         	
         <div class="l">Her strength, stay my faint heart and still
            	console 
         </div>
         	
         <div class="l">A little longer; with a poor man's bread </div>
         	
         <div class="l">Succor my poverty, and pay my toll </div>
         	
         <div class="l">To Charon when to Lethe I am led. </div>
         	
         <div class="l">And ever round her shine the aureole </div>
         	
         <div class="l">Of my sad verses after I am dead. </div>
