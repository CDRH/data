      </div>
      
      
      <p>That's a devil of a hard break, and I'm more sorry than I can say! I wish I could
         be with you while you are laid up. Your note indicates that you are standing it with
         your accustomed philosophic good sense, which I sometimes envy you. Anyway, here's
         love, best of Comrades. I suppose you will be able to keep the magazine going by using
         a stenographer.
