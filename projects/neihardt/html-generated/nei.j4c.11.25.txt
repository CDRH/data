      <p>Robert M. McBride &amp; Co (N.Y.) are publishing a series of "Modern American Writers"
         biographies, each selling for $1. Cabell, Wharton, Dreiser, Menchen and O'Neill have
         thus far been issued. I have seen none of these, but judge that a reading of one or
         two of them (Cabell, O'Neill, I'd say) might help you in deciding upon the form of
         your next book.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wanted to make this suggestion while I had it in mind.</p>
