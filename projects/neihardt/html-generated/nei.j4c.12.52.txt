<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>I have just gotten back from lecturing at Topeka and Wichita. Big crowds and find response. It was easy. I am impressed more than ever with the great possibilities for pushing the CYCLE in the schools. Between the Mississippi and the Rockies one hundred thousand could be sold easily, if anything at all were done about it. I do wish we could look forward to a part-year connection with Macmillans for you. Does this seem impossible to you now? Yes, your ex-governor would be of great value on our board, which already shows some great names, notably David Starr Jordan, Clarence Darrow, Richard Burton, etc. I'm in a hurry this morning and can't write more.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">With endless love,</span>

<br/>Jno

<p>I could almost make a living from lecture engagements that are <u>offered me.</u></p>
