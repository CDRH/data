      <div class="salute">My dear Mr. Chapman:— </div>
      
      
      <p>I have found your "Learning and Other Essays" in the latest batch of books sent me
         by the Times Book Review, and I want to express to you my admiration and gratitude
         for the work in a more personal way than the nature of an article would allow me to

         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Shakespeare​ ">Shakespere</a>
         ​" my constant desk companion. There is 
         <u>space</u> about your book.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This is just a sincere brotherly word.</p>
      
      <div class="closer">
         
         <div class="salute">Yours, </div>
         
         
         <br></br>Jno. G. Neihardt
