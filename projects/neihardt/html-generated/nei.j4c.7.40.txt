      <p>You must have received proofs of 
         <u>The</u> 
         <u>Pack</u> by now.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It has struck me that perhaps you were thinking of including Trombley's focus on Columbus.
         I would favor including it if the lines I marked can be shaped up in time. We could
         drop a short poem somewhere to make room. I'm eager to have as much good or promising
         stuff in the 
         <u>Pack</u> as possible.
      </p>
