      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Latham: </div>
      
      
      <p>Many thanks for your friendly letter. Altho you make no promise, you do say that Macmillans
         will reconsider the matter of offering the 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Cycle</u>
      </p>
      <p> to the public, and that undoubtedly this will be done during the coming fall. I do
         hope that those who consider the proposition will actually know the 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Cycle</u>
      </p>
      <p>. Figures on a balance sheet will tell nothing that they need to know in this case.
         As for the market, we all know that markets are largely a matter of contrivance in
         these days. When the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Cycle</u>
      </p>
      <p> is offered, there must be preparation. Among other things, it must not be taken for
         granted

      <p>

      <p>
         that reviewers will know anything about the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Cycle</u>
      </p>
      <p>, and it must be assumed that, even though they know nothing, they </p>
      <p>write as though they </p>
      <p>were thoroughly well informed. I can and will furnish the necessary article to be
         sent to all reviewers. One 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>brief</u>
      </p>
      <p> reading notice, such as your publicity department sent out, would be ridiculously
         inadequate. This is only one important point. You as publisher, and I as book-review
         editor for 25 years, know plenty of others, and we are not naive enough to suppose
         that merit is enough in such a time as ours.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I note that the one-volume edition of the </p>
      <p>

      <p> and </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p> has done very well. It is the volume with

      <p>the Macmillans force has tried to do something.</p>

      </p>
      <p> curious aspect of this whole affair is that I am on Macmillans' side. It </p>
      <p> would be foolish to suppose that, as </p>
      <p>a business firm, you can afford to </p>
      <p>
         <u>print</u>
      </p>
      <p> the volumes of the </p>
      <p>

      <p>, and then drop the matter, just when the purpose of years has been achieved. The

         We have

      <p>, and we should certainly make the most of that fact when the completed </p>

         <u>Cycle</u>
      </p>
      <p> is offered.</p>
      
      
      <p>Incidentally, I shall be ready with a suitable Introduction when you want it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Is it a certainty that the Book-of-the-Month Club could not be interested — or some
         other such 
         <del class=""></del>agency? The Book-of-the-Month Bulletin has said fine things of the last two 
         <del class=""></del>volumes.

      <p>I do believe you are genuinely friendly to me and that you believe in the 
         
         <u>Cycle</u>. That's why I feel free to speak out to you. The great Macmillan Company is being
         
         <del class=""></del> penny-wise and pound-foolish in this matter.

      <p>I'm about to begin a lyrical thing to be called "I Shall Be Young with You" — something
         I have kept myself from writing of 25 years. It might well be used as a dedication
         of the 
         <u>Cycle</u>.
