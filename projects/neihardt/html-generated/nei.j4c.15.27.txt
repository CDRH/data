                <p>I 'woke greatly troubled this morning over my hasty letter to you mailed yesterday. Troubled because it seems now almost sure to hurt you, whereas that was infinitely far from what I had in mind. Your brief paragraph about women was merely gracious &amp; not intended to have a deep significance. But it <span class="unclear ">[offers?]</span> that I have been disgusted &amp; saddened by the outrageous woman-flattery now so conspicuous throughout our literature; Together with the pitiful feminization of our own culture, such as it is. I thought of this when I wrote you, and was unjust in doing so. I not only love you, but honor you as an intelligence.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway you <del><span class="unclear ">[have?]</span></del>shall have forgiven me before this note reaches you.</p>
