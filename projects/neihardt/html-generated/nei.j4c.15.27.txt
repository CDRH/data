      <p>I 'woke greatly troubled this morning over my hasty letter to you mailed yesterday.
         Troubled because it seems now almost sure to hurt you, whereas that was infinitely
         far from what I had in mind. Your brief paragraph about women was merely gracious
         &amp; not intended to have a deep significance. But it 
         <span class="">[offers?]</span> that I have been disgusted &amp; saddened by the outrageous woman-flattery now so conspicuous
         throughout our literature; Together with the pitiful feminization of our own culture,
         such as it is. I thought of this when I wrote you, and was unjust in doing so. I not
         only love you, but honor you as an intelligence.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Anyway you 
         <del class="[have?]">have</del>shall have forgiven me before this note reaches you.
      </p>
