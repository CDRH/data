      <div class="salute">Dear Mott: - </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm just leaving for a month's lecture trip, and I want to tell you something before
         I go. Macmillans have just written me, proposing the publication of my collected poems
         in one volume next fall. This pleases me, naturally, and I feel sure it will please
         you. It will be a volume of 700 pages.
         
      </p>    
      
      <p>I was very glad to hear from you and to know that you have completed your work for
         the doctorate. Congratulations!
         
      </p>
