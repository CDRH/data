<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:-</span>
 
<p>I am rejoicing with you, for I know just how you were feeling when you wrote that glowing Sunday letter. You had just 13, and you knew it.</p>

<p>You don't owe me anything, dear comrade. If you got anything of value by associating with a working post, the credit is all yours. How many professors would even suspect that there might be a chance to learn something not in the holy courses already? It's your free spirit and your deep-seated love of poetry that will make you a more and more compelling teach of - no, not of literature. It can't be done. Your spontaneous enthusiasm <del/> is simply contagious. That's the only teaching of beauty, of great moods. You just absolutely love the stuff, and they come to love it too.</p>

<p>I'm very happy right now in the knowledge that you are feeling inspired in your work, for you <u>are</u> inspired every time that that glow comes over you. That glow is creative; and without such <del/> creation, the makers would have no chance in this world.</p>

<p>I do sincerely expect you to be the best, teacher of literature in West Virginia. When you feel like that, you are using the power that all makers use. It's the same thing.</p>

<p>I've just been appointed a member of the National Commitee of the Custer Memorial Association. Big doings next year - Special coinage, special stamp issue being worked for, and other things.</p>

<p><u>Fine progress on THE MESSIAH.</u></p>
