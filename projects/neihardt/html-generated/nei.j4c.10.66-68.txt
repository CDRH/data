      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>Canby, ed of The Sat. Review of Lit., has just asked me to review "Buffalo Days" by
         Col. Wheeler for him. This looks friendly. I expect to see your review 
      </p>
      <p> soon, there are 3300 books in The U.S. This fall, + naturally the books that are
         not to be classed as "Timely" will wait on the others. At least, the big reviews have
         not put me off with perfunctory paragraphs, which means that the book is to receive
         more. I'm told that last Sunday the N.Y. Times gave the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Song</u>
      </p>
      <p> "much space" + that the reviewer "got of key twice". I suppose he knocked by way
         of showing what a hell of a poet he could be if he only cared to try. It is the "much
         space" that interests me, not what was said. On the other hand, The N.Y. Eve Post,
         Outlook, N.Y. Herald-Tribune Cleveland Plain Dealer + The Midland have said bull things.
         No matter either way, except as discussion is essential in gaining the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>attention</u>
      </p>
      <p> of readers. Time is the only authoritative critic, + we are living in a ridiculous
         generation + country - raw, dishonest, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="">[ignorant?]</span>
      </p>
      <p> four-flushing, sex-mad, obsessed with the desire to be smart. This, of course, applying
         to the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>mass impression.</u>

         There are plenty of fine spirits, but they are now almost totally helpless.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am 
         <u>not</u> doing anything for the Post-Dispatch that note referred to the cycle. I hope love
         will let you do a full page article. If he does, let loose + say all you want to say.
         St. Louis is an important strategic point for the scheme.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Judge will be down for a vacation Tuesday. He is fairly close to Alexander + perhaps
         he'll know something about the magazine. How I wish you could be its editor! But there
         is only too good reason to suppose that that crowd is not concerned with large issues.
         Not one of the bunch is capable of your honest dedication.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Alas, Comrade it requires a vast amount of vitality to remain hopeful in a world so
         little evolved! Every good thing is condemned to death on sight + can win only through
         the most atrocious struggle. It 
         <u>"pays"</u> to be utterly like the mob. But I prefer starvation if a choice be necessary.
