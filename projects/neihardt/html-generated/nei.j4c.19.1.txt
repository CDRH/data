      Mr. George Steele Seymour,
      4917 Blackstone Avenue,
      Chicago, Illinois.
      
      
      
      
      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour: </div>
      
      
      
      <p>Of course I shall be glad to serve as Chairman of the committee, and certainly it's
         an honor to follow Hamlin Garland.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It would be fine to have William Allen White and Ellen Glasgow. How about Gladys Hasty
         Carrol, Conrad Richter of Santa Fe, Frost, Stephen Benet, Joseph Auslander?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm far along with The Song of Jed Smith, the central narrative of my Cycle, and the
         last. Having a particularly happy time with it and expect to be ready for publication
         in the spring of '41. I shall have spent 18 years out of the past 27 on the Cycle.
         This might be the news you want for the Bookfellows.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I want to see you again.</p>
