      <h3>The White Radiance</h3>
      
      <h4>Are We Now Peculiarly Liable to Form Mistaken Literary Judgments?</h4>
      
      
      <p>It is a well-known fact, and one that has furnished vast comfort 
         <span class="">[?]</span> many a misguided literary aspirant, that contemporaneous literary criticism has very
         often proven ridiculously inadequate.  Re
         <span class="">[?]</span> there has been published a volume entitled Famous Literary 
         <span class="">[?]</span>, in which are gathered together a few choice vials of criti- 
         <span class="">[?]</span> poured upon the heads of those whom now we view as 
         <span class="">[?]</span>.  It is a rather portly book; yet it is only one of many 
         <span class="">[?]</span> that could be compiled.  Also, if the compiler’s appetite for 
         <span class="">[?]</span> mistaken literary judgments were not appeased after so 
         <span class="">[?]</span> a feast of futile ire, he might prepare an equally imposing 
         <span class="">[?]</span> of ill-fated eulogies.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Many an alleged immortal has succumbed to the inclement social weather of our world;
         and many an apparently puny infant has 
         <span class="">[?]</span> the croups of cultural autumns and the colics of new 
         <span class="">[?]</span> in the green.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Such a library of misconceived union as has been suggested here 
         <span class="">[?]</span> make jocose reading for those of us who share the curious and fairly prevalent delusion
         that 
         <span class="">[?]</span>  the first moderns, stand triumphantly unbunkable upon our 
         <span class="">[?]</span>  of time.  But there are reasons for suspecting that we are now living in a time
         peculiarly liable to gross errors in literary judgment.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Literature is merely one of many social phenomena, and the literary 
         <span class="">[?]</span> of any age are to be concerned first of all with reference to the prevailing social
         background. 
         <span class="">[?]</span>  in society proceeds, like any other growth, by alternate periods of increasing strain
         — which 
         <span class="">[?]</span>  seem almost static in their peacefulness — and periods of aud-
         <span class="">[?]</span>  release and unfoldment.  Slow moving pictures of a developing past have been seen
         by almost everyone, no doubt, and will be remembered in this connection.  The period
         of release and violent unfoldment which we are not experiencing may be viewed as having
         begun with the French Revolution which was broadly speaking, the triumph of the individualistic
         idea over the monarchical idea.  The extreme of concentration had been reached in
         the reign of Louis XIV 
         <span class="">[?]</span> the centrifugal, so called democratic movement began.  Its infin-
         <span class="">[?]</span> was apparent in the fundamental realm of economics long before it began to affect
         what we call the higher values — those of literature, the arts, philosophy, religion,
         ethics.  It was not until about 
         <span class="">[?]</span> years ago that individualism 
         <span class="">[?]</span> triumphant in industry, struck the realm of higher values like a whirlwind.  Whether
         or not the 
         <span class="">[?]</span> has attained or is about to attain its maximum violence, who can say?  We know that
         many very respectable old signboards are flying all over the place and that many a
         private window, once 
         <span class="">[?]</span> serenely upon a world of 
         <span class="">[?]</span> seemed eternal certainties has been broken in by chilling blasts of doubt.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To realize the change that has 
         <span class="">[?]</span> place in literary attitudes, as a result of individualism worked 
         <span class="">[?]</span> to its logical conclusions, one 
         <span class="">[?]</span> only to consider the rigid rules that were laid down by absolute 
         <span class="">[?]</span> authority for the writers of pre-Revolutionary France.  The [ ? archic] idea, long
         established in 
         <span class="">[?]</span> lower realms of human activity has penetrated to the realm of art.  Then tradition
         was every-
         <span class="">[?]</span> 
         <span class="">[?]</span> practically 
         <span class="">[?]</span> 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
         <span class="">[?]</span> patient of all restraints, we are certain to overestimate the essential value of
         those works that most violently express the antisocial mood: and yet all of our genuine
         values are in their very nature social.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Doubtless Shelley had no thought of literary criticism when he wrote the strangely
         luminous lines:
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="lg">
         	
         <div class="l">Life like a dome of many colored glass </div>
         
         <div class="l">Stains the white radiance of eternity, </div> 
      </div>
      
      
      <p>but he expressed a truth that is applicable here.  The light of understanding and
         persuasion by which men live is constantly changing.  New generations develop new
         social moods within which, as in a colored atmosphere, all views are colored.  When
         the light of the time is red, as we may say, most men will think the truth is of that
         color; and the blues and yellows of other generations may seem absurd or pathetic
         or merely curious.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yet what is any color but a fragment of some single white radiance?  And what is the
         white radiance in our special application of the figure, but a vision of the larger
         truth about men and the human adventure in general, as opposed to the merely fragmentary
         view in keeping with the bias of the moment?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Eternity is a long, long stretch, and we can not follow our poet so far.  Human literary
         history is much briefer, and here and there, throughout the whole length of it, finishes
         of the white radiance may be noted by those who have the eyes to see.  Even in our
         own confused time of stormy red the white ray breaks in many a single line or passage:
         and now and then a whole book may glow with it.  But it is the red that wakes the
         loudest clamor.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To scorn the red is to have no sympathetic understanding of one’s own time — and that
         is a pitiful disaster.  To seek the larger human values in that one necessarily transient
         key, is to miss the larger values.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>More than once has the restless general consciousness of men passed through all the
         shades and colors of the social spectrum from the naïve germinating violet on through
         the slowly maturing blues, the flowering greens, the mellowly fruiting yellows and
         the tempestous revolting reds.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>But the truth about the light was never to be perceived by the split 
         <span class="">[?]</span>.
