      <div class="salute">Gentlemen: </div>
      
      
      <p>Three years ago in May your body did me the honor of conferring upon me the title
         of Professor of Poetry in the University of Nebraska.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have learned that friends of the institution have recently expressed themselves
         as favoring my appointment to an active position. While sincerely appreciating whatever
         feeling of the sort there may be, and grateful as I am to your body for the honor
         conferred, I am compelled to offer my resignation of the honorary position, and to
         ask that you make your acceptance known to the public, that there may be no further
         thought of the matter. Duties recently assumed would make it impossible for me to
         accept an active position at the University if one were offered. The honorary connection
         can be of no value to the University, and might now prove an embarassment to me.
      </p>
