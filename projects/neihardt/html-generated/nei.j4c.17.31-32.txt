      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Latham: </div>
      
      
      
      <p>
         <del class=""></del>Thanks for yours of the 17th.
         <del class=""></del> Mr. Jack has finished his story. After we have gone over it, my daughter will copy
         it, &amp; then it will be sent to you. I have read only the first eight chapters, as I
         told you, and cannot be sure that he has succeeded; but I have a strong suspicion
         in his favor. I shall be glad to see the the clippings &amp; publicity material. 
         <del class=""></del>It is good of you to send it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm forwarding you my daughter's copy of Black Elk Speaks, as it is 
         <u>the</u> only one 
         <del class=""></del>here that is in good condition. I'll have other copies 
         <del class=""></del>soon, but I feel there should be no delay.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In reading the book, linger a bit with the Great Vision.
         <del class=""></del> It is really unique, &amp; certainly there is a strange beauty in it - and 
         <del class=""></del>deep meaning.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The book was a by-product of my research for 
         <u>The Song of the Messiah</u>.
      </p>

      <p>Enid has just told me that she 
         <del class="saved">saved</del>has saved the 
         <u>Black Elk</u> clippings, some of which I enclose.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You may return the book when you are through with it.</p>

      P. S. 
      <p>The Deloria letter is especially to be noted, as the writer is an authority.</p>
