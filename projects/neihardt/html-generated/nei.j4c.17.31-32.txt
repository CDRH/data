                <p><del/>Thanks for yours of the 17th.<del/> Mr. Jack has finished his story. After we have gone over it, my daughter will copy it, &amp; then it will be sent to you. I have read only the first eight chapters, as I told you, and cannot be sure that he has succeeded; but I have a strong suspicion in his favor. I shall be glad to see the the clippings &amp; publicity material. <del/>It is good of you to send it.</p>
                
                <p>I'm forwarding you my daughter's copy of Black Elk Speaks, as it is <u>the</u> only one <del/>here that is in good condition. I'll have other copies <del/>soon, but I feel there should be no delay.</p>
                
                <p>In reading the book, linger a bit with the Great Vision.<del/> It is really unique, &amp; certainly there is a strange beauty in it - and <del/>deep meaning.</p>
                    
                <p>The book was a by-product of my research for <u>The Song of the Messiah</u>.</p>
