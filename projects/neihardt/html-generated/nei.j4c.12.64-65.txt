      <p>Dr. Brown has suddenly decided not to reset the WARS for the school edition. I think
         the reason is that they are thinking of saving the expense of resetting with a view
         to advertising the school editions. If that is the idea, it is certainly a good one.
         Brown wants me to send the Notes as soon as possible, and so I am wondering how soon
         you can send me any additional material that may seem necessary after you have gone
         over the text again.
