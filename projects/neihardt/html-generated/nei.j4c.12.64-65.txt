<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>Dr. Brown has suddenly decided not to reset the WARS for the school edition. I think the reason is that they are thinking of saving the expense of resetting with a view to advertising the school editions. If that is the idea, it is certainly a good one. Brown wants me to send the Notes as soon as possible, and so I am wondering how soon you can send me any additional material that may seem necessary after you have gone over the text again.</p>
