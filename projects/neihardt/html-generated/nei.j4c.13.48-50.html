      <p>We are all glad to know that Mrs. House has gone through her ordeal in good shape,
         and that the situation is hopeful. It must have been fierce to worry about what might
         happen. Give her our kindest thoughts.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>About Bierce. The best way to get at the best of him is to read the collection of
         short stories called IN THE MIDST OF 
      </p>
      <p>LIFE published by The Modern Library, Inc., New York City. Get a review copy of this.
         It has been out only a few months, though, of course, all the stories are well known.
         DeCastro wrote me a letter of thanks for "understanding" him. He said the others didn't
         get him. The "Understanding" consisted in my reading between the lines. You will read
         what I read, and what DeCastro assures me is meant, that DeCastro was shielding a
         man he loved. He told the truth all right enough, but he 
      </p>
      <p> was constantly trying to put the finest face on things. Bierce was a hard case, and
         he really abused everyone who came in contact with him. Castro got his share, and
         you'll note. But Castro loved Bierce,

         and so I believe that Bierce, with all his burrs, deserved love. But, golly, what
         a hard man to live with! You'll feel that Bierce was all his life a wounded man. He
         was on the defensive, secretly, when he seemed most aggressive. But he was a genius.
         Use your sympathy on DeCastro's book, and you'll get something good for both DeCastro
         and Bierce.

      <p>I'm in a hurry, but this carries the old love.</p>

      <p>There was something genuinely 
         <u>royal</u> in Bierce's mentality.
