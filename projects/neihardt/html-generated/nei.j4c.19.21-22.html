      <p>I've been reading your precious letter of Nov. 27th again. Many, many thanks! It's
         a dark world, but there is light. It breaks through your letter.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm wondering if I may not see you - and Mrs. Graves - this winter. A Lincoln school
         man has suggested a tour of Nebraska high schools, and this may work out. He has in
         mind small fees, consecutive dates, and a plan whereby money may be raised for Red
         Cross. I'd love that. We'll see.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mona has done two beautiful things recently, and I am her caster. We can now cast
         the most difficult figures.
