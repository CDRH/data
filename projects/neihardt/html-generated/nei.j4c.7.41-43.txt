      <p>You guessed wrong about the manuscript business. The reason I haven't sent you any
         is as follows: Ever since I've known you, I've been writing on the epic cycle. Maybe
         not for the whole period, but at least for over eight years. In that time I've written
         only "Hugh Glass", "Three Friends", "The Splendid Wayfaring" and now "The Song of
         the Indian Wars". Extracts of long poems of this sort don't make the correct impression,
         since it is the mood of the whole that counts, the cumulative effect. I've always
         thought it fine of you to send me manuscript poems, and I prize them so much that
         I keep them all carefully. I don't know how to break even with you. Maybe my profound
         admiration of your wizardry lifts a little of the debt. Anyway, I don't believe there
         is anyone who admires your artistry more than I do, even though I grieve to think
         that you aren't washed in the blood of the lamb. O George, I'm afraid you're a naughty
         man and that you'll never see Heaven and the angels. (Weepter)

      <p>You ask my opinion of "small town" literature. I hate to say it, Old Man, but the
         "small town", as now being exploited by the best-selling guys, is an urban superstition,
         a mere literary convention. The "small town" disappeared with the coming of the automobile,
         the movie, the phonograph, the widely circulated newspapers and magazines. It may
         be that

         there is a small town here and there in out of the way places; but I'm sure they must
         be scarce. On the other hand, it would be possible to discover the "large town" and
         make it appear to be wholly a jazz proposition, which it isn't. Such general-

         izations are usually false. There are sophisticated and unsophisticated people in and out
         of both large and small towns. There are different manners, too — all shin deep.

      <p>I'll be on the road in less than six weeks. Will be at Stanford November 15th.</p>
      
      
      <p>Will there be any chance for you and me to get gentl
         <del class=""></del>y drunk together in some secluded place? I want to weep with you over your sins.

      <p>Say, Old Man, that poem in which the lady dances is a holy gem. I'll change the line
         as you wish.

      <p>Good luck in everything, including horiz

      <p>I've run out of ink, which is a d— lie. I'm simply too lazy to hunt my pen. It's very
         hot here. I'm going swimming in an hour. Give me some information on the art of natation
         (learned language!) I know the following strokes &amp; can do them so so: breast, over-arm,
         Trudgen, crawl. back  what others should I know?
