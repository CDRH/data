         <u>Dear</u> Seymours: 
      </div>
      
      
      <p>Not much to say except what you should already know - that it was great to be with
         you, bless your good hearts!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm just now beginning to get back into the right world for 
         <u>Jed Smith</u>, and shall be going ahead soon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Of course I'll find a M. S. for you. You must have received the Aulard. And you must
         have The Divine Enchantment - really rare, because I burned all I could find.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It's good that you'll see Bacheller. I'll bet he's a dear fellow. That's what matters.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'm sincerely interested in 
         <u>The Agent</u>. What material! And F. W. S. will know how to handle it.
      </p>
