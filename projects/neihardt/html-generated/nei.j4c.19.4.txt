      <p>My son and I are leaving for a considerable trip East, and this time his wife will
         accompany us. We plan to be in Chicago over the weekend before the meeting with "the
         boys and girls". My son and his wife have friends and relatives with whom they can
         stay if there's no room for the whole expeditionary force in your territory.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you want to drop me a line about anything, do so at the following address, where
         you can catch me on 
         <u>April 29th</u>: General Delivery, Morgantown, West Virginia.
      </p>

      <p>Almost forgot to thank you for the 
         <u>twenty!</u> Many thanks.
