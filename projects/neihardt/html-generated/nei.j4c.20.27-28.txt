                <p>I just want to say hello and to tell you I still feel the fine glow of my visit with you. (I wrote you shortly after I reached home.)

                <p>Several times in the first gray light of morning I've wakened and thought of you, Nita, <del/> on a "bird-walk", <del/> and often I've seen again those magnificent water-falls and the long vistas you showed me, Slade.</p>
