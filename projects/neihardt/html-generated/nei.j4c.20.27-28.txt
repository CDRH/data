      <p>I just want to say hello and to tell you I still feel the fine glow of my visit with
         you. (I wrote you shortly after I reached home.) This has been a busy time, getting
         all the grades lined up. I have a remarkably efficient grader, who left me nothing
         to do but to check his work. Now I'm off until mid-Sept.

      <p>We are doing a lot of building, which will continue several months. One </p>
      <p> barn, 16'x28', is about finished, and next we'll begin 
         
         
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">28</h6>
      <p>
         on an indoor riding barn, 100'x30', which will run north of the big barn and be a
         part of it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Several times in the first gray light of morning I've wakened and thought of you,
         Nita, 
         <del class=""></del> on a "bird-walk", 
         <del class=""></del> and often I've seen again those magnificent water-falls and the long vistas you showed
         me, Slade.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Bless you both!</p>
