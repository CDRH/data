      <p>Gosh I did forget to enclose that Mencken article in my last. Here it is, and it is
         certainly a good one. You are going to have a bully time editing your magazine, and
         here and there you will help to fortify some worthwhile person against the almost
         incredible roughneckism of our mob literature. That is worth doing and will keep you
         from going stale. I am not in the least concerned with America's soul, and I believe
         that no amount of the wisest talking or writing can help the general situation in the least. At bottom, the 
         <del class="whole">whole</del> question of America's soul is purely economic.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Things go finely here, and I love you most sincerely.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, the cycle is certainly showing signs of genuine vitality.</p>
