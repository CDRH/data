      <p>On the second page of my reply to your Hattie letter, this sentence occurs: "Since
         then I have written but one lyric which appeared in Century". For this sentence, substitute
         the following, if you decide to print the thing anywhere: "Since then I have written
         nothing for magazine publication.
         <del class=""></del> This, I find, is the fact, the lyric mentioned having been written before the time
         stated. 
         <del class=""></del>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I didn't tell you in my unofficial letter of the other day that Hattie and I got into
         a row very soon after POETRY started. The row began as soon as I saw which way  she
         was blowing. I think it was that ass, Ezry, who cooled my ardor. After that the braying
         was deafening, and my love never returned.
      </p>

      </div>                
      
      <p>When 
         <u>Poetry</u> was started, the lady gave me every opportunity to become immortal, but the row was
         fatal.
