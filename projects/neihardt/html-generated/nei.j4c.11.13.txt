Mr. John G. Neihardt,
Branson, Mo.


<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Neihardt:</span>

<p>In one of your recent letters, you suggested that we ought to get up a little booklet on THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS, and you offered to prepare the material. I would be very glad if you would do this, and will see that prompt use is made of it in our spring campaign on your work.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Sincerely yours,</span>

<span class="salute">Dearest Comrade:</span>

<p>I'll furnish the press clippings for this booklet. Would you have time to do a brief <del/>article (say 300 words) to be used in the booklet, and covering the significance of the three volumes of the cycle published, with especial emphasis on the <u>Wars</u>? If so, I should have the stuff very soon.</p>

<p>I'm jumping sidewise with my page for the Journal-Post, but am pushing <u>Messiah</u> too, - faster than usual. Might mention Collected Poems to be published in the Fall &amp; comment on scope &amp; volume thereof.</p>

<div class="note">I'll answer your good letter soon. So glad Mary is Mary House again.</div>       
     
<div class="note"><u>Latest Idea:</u> I think, if you can write the brief article, it should be sent direct to H.S. Latham by you. I'll send the other stuff from here.</div>  
<div class="note">You would probably remark <span class="unclear ">[in passing?]</span> that <u>Friends</u> + Glass are already "classics" spreading widely in the schools</div>
