                <p>Yes, another birthday — 50 of them so far! As for "whopping sunsets", the stuff of <em class="hi">ours</em> is already in existence, and nothing but a bit of <em class="hi">obvious</em> lying is needed to prove it. Not that I give a damn, but it's so. I have more power — or rather have access to greater sources of power — than ever before; and care less to use it than ever. But, being here, one might as well let loose. I suppose; though I'm a bit fed up on kindergarten stuff &amp; should be glad to try the first grade somewhere or other. If <em class="hi">this</em> were all, then, obscene Rabelaisian laughter <del/> would be the most pertinent comment; and when I say this I mean something very definite that I could work out convincingly a few hours of conversation. But, this <em class="hi">isn't</em> all. That's the only reason I'm at all willing to stay &amp; fool around Our whole social structure is too funny for the most abandoned ribaldry to express; but there are fine spirits imprisoned here. We will live on for them, humbly, hoping to help.</p> <span class="closer"><span class="salute">Endless love, Comrade.</span> <br/>Jno.</span>
