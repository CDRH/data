      <p>Send me your magazine for the enclosed dollar. I wish I were able to buy a thousand
         subscriptions. Sterling gave me a copy of the first issue, and it's great stuff. Your
         work on Religion promises to be a masterpiece. I read "Spring Song" to my wife, and
         she wept — though she is no sentimentalist. Also, I felt something like smoke in my
         throat.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>Success to you!</p>

      <p>I have only now found a dollar that I could tear away from the Grocer, Butcher, et
         al, and here it is.
