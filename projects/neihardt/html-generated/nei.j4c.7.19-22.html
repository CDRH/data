      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>It hurt me to write that letter to you yesterday, and it hurts me more today since
         I have read yours of the 15th, just received. I know the sort of man you are — sincere,
         enthusiastic and generous; and I prize your friendship. But I can't see that it would
         be the right thing for me to leave here in May under the circumstances. You have been
         working unselfishly for me, and that's what hurts.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>But, of course, you can get someone in my place who will doubtless make more of an
         impression, and there is still plenty of time left you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mrs. Newman's letter is amusing, for she utterly misses the point in surmising that
         Cheney was left out because he is not a "new" poet. O damn that word "new"! It makes
         my head ache. I have fought "newness" more than Cheney has, I am sure; and by "newness"
         I do not mean any serious modification of tradition. I know this is no static universe.
         I am pragmatist, and I know that the world of men and things is dynamic. I welcome
         change. I do not honor upstart idiocy. If I have prejudices, they would most decidedly
         be in favor of Cheney. The reason for his exclusion was simply this: he sent work
         that does not represent his powers, and Mrs. Newman would agree, if she could see
         what he contributed. However, it is right that we should not hurt the old man; and
         as for me, I respect his and like much of his work. You may say that he was left out
         of the list by mistake.

         You may say that the mistake was mine; but you need not tell that the mistake consisted
         in my not thinking of Cheney's sensibilities. Yes, by all means, let us include some
         of Cheney. I send his contributions herewith. They are worthless, and I leave it to
         you to choose what should be used. It would be better if we could get the right to
         use one of his finer things — something already published. When I see the proof, I
         will know what can best be dropped by way of making room for the Cheney additions.
         Please understand that I do most heartily what the old fellow represented. Make it
         plain to anyone who wants to know, that Cheney's name was omitted by a mistake of
         the editor-in-chief.

      <p>I understand much that you do not say about the Moody affair. I am not in good standing
         with the Monroe-Henderson crowd, for I have taken the trouble to sting them more than
         once in the Minneapolis Journal. Also, I have fought some of their pet curiosities
         just for the fun of it. The difference between the crowd and myself is this: I am
         not trying to be literary; 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>I'm doing something</u>
      </p>
      <p>. To me, poetry is not a social stunt. It's merely a means to an end — the preservation
         of a great race-mood of courage that was developed west of the Missouri River in the
         19th century. I am not interested in schools and movements; and I knew too much of
         literary history and of the changing attitudes of mankind through

      <p>moved by mountebanks</p>
      <p> and their antics.</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, I hope to see you and Mrs. Seymour and a few other sincere people next winter
         when I pass through.

      <p>By the way, I have just heard that the Nebraska Legislature has passed House Roll
         467, declaring me "Laureate of Nebraska and the Prairies". It's the first time in
         America. How is that for a state said to be concerned only with corn and hogs? The
         house vote was 80 to 2, the Senate was unanimous, and the Governor promised weeks
         ago to sign the bill.
