<p>Enid is with me in the office today, and she has been copying occasional pages while I have been going over the MS of the Notes. I am genuinely happy over the work you have done. You are right in saying that the notes are better than those for GLASS and the FRIENDS. I feel that you were all there and that you got under the skin pretty deep. All this should be a real help to students and teachers. As to compensation, if I could pay all my debts in as pleasant a way as you insist I have paid my debt to you, I'd be on the road to wealth. What you say does make me happy, very happy.</p>

<p>It's good news that Piper will do Frost for you. I think Stuff might do something good about me, as Muns<del/>on, who is close to him, has answered me that he is a very strong fan now, and has even gone so far as to say that it is a disgrace to the University that I am not tied there.

primarily literary. He is a fine sane man, and a real friend.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sherman would do Cather for you. He could do a fine thing on her.</p>

<p>It's a delight to know of Mary's success in getting on the inside at Columbia. "Some girl" is right!</p>

<p>The All-America Movement is getting to be pretty impressive, and if it moves, as I think it will, I may die rich and despised. In addition to this, strange to say, I am gambling a bit on the stock the reasonably poor man who must live dangerously.</p>
