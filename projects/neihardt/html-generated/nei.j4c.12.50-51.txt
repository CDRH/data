      <p>I don't know of a better brief statement about the modern poetry situation than you
         have made. If

      <p>your Quarterly does much of that sort of thing, and I'm sure it will, it should be
         a whiz. I think it would be better to get going with general stuff before tackling
         a special number on me. It's barely possible that Jessie Rittenhouse would do a special
         article on my COLLECTED POEMS for you. Try her. I have some people in mind who would
         probably write for you after they have learned that it is you are trying to do. I'll
         name some of these later. Be bold and go after the good ones. They will be nearly
         as easy to get as less important people, I think, especially after you have got to
         going

         setting the WARS looks good to me. Nothing is lacking for complete success in our
         time for the whole cycle but an arrangment to put you on the road under circumstances
         advantageous to you. I think that 
      </p>
      <p>if this cannot be done within a reasonable number of years, real success will come
         slowly and after we are gone. I will get at the Notes tomorrow. I will send you two
         of Cummings' books and I want you to examine them carefully. Hold your nose before
         you begin. You can easily find out from the NEW REPUBLIC when it published the lauditory
         article on these insane obscenities. After you have learned this, you might care to
         write an article for their Correspondence Column. And if you write the sort of article
         that will be in your heart -- and how could 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>you</u>
      </p>
      <p> do otherwise? - I doubt if it will be printed. I'm in very good position to know
         a good deal about modern methods of promotion in the publishing world. The situation
         is almost incredible.
