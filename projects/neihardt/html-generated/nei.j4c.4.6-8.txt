      <p>Greatly delighted to hear that "Lillith" is finished! And I'll eat her up when you
         send her to me — married man that I am! It's big beautiful stuff.

      <p>I've got an idea. You know Leonardo da Vinci 
         <del class=""></del> wrote of Helen of Troy in her old age. Imagined her looking in her mirror. Well,
         she had words to say to the image she saw there. Why don't you find those words somewhere
         in that head of yours &amp; put them down in a series of sonnets, or in any other form?
         It would be a riffing thing for 
         <u>you</u> to do.

      <p>Often I have things told to me in sleep. Sometimes it is very good verse, sometimes
         it's a lewd joke. The other night when I had  been up &amp; was just dozing off, I got
         this:

         <div class="l">There was a young actress from Glasgow, </div>
         	
         <div class="l">whose acting was quite a fiasco; </div>
         	
         <div class="l">But critics, who shared her </div>

      <p>Am pushing on with the "Friends" at a steady pace.</p>
      	
      <p>Bless you for caring for me at all, not to mention placing me as you do!</p>
      	
      <p>Good luck!</p>
