      <p>I'm delighted to hear from you again! I don't forget you and Mrs. Graves - faithful
         ones!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>My son and I will leave for a lecture trip in the East early Friday morning. If I
         don't get to see you, come on anyway. Mona will be here and happy to visit with you.
         She says: "Tell the 
         <em>three</em> ladies to spend a night with me". There'll be plenty of room.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you come, Mona can tell you about the completion of the 
         <u>Cycle of the West</u>.
