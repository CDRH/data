      <p>Have you seen copies of the new issues the Modern Readers' Series? If not, I'll have
         a copy of each issue (trade and school) sent to you. Very beautiful editions, certainly;
         and considering the price, triumphs of book-making. The trade edition is half leather.
         Ashley H. Thorndike is general editor of the Series, so we have noisy backing indeed!!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Golly, I'm eager for the day when they send you out all over the U.S.! Do you think
         of this seriously? I feel certain Macmillans would do this soon.
      </p>
