<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>Have you seen copies of the new issues the Modern Readers' Series? If not, I'll have a copy of each issue (trade and school) sent to you. Very beautiful editions, certainly; and considering the price, triumphs of book-making. The trade edition is half leather. Ashley H. Thorndike is general editor of the Series, so we have noisy backing indeed!!</p>

<p>Golly, I'm eager for the day when they send you out all over the U.S.! Do you think of this seriously? I feel certain Macmillans would do this soon.</p>

    With love always,</span>

<br/>Jno.
</span>
<p>Your new position is given in the new edition. Show that to your president!</p>
