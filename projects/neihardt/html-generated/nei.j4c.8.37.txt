      <p>Many thanks for the clippings from Aberdeen and Mount Vernon. I need to see such things,
         for I never seem to know just how an audience feels about what I have to offer. Often
         while I am before an audience, I waken from a sort of sleep and feel panic-stricken,
         wondering if I am boring them horribly. And this, in spite of the fact that I have
         no fear whatever of a crowd and don't understand stage fright. I knew the crowd at
         Cornell liked my stuff, because it remained to tell me. But I didn't know a thing
         about Aberdeen. I had a feeling that perhaps I hadn't quite gotten across.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You may be sure that I know of your loyalty to the scheme to which I am devoting my
         life; and you may be sure that I deeply appreciate your help.
      </p>

      <p>I've sent the clippings to Mr. Long of Omaha, who is managing me in the West. He will return them to you.</p>
