<span class="salute">My dear Rev. Seymour:-</span>

<p><u>In re dett recently concurred.</u></p>

<p>Yours of the 2nd instantaneously received and contents suspected, together with highly partial submittance for same.</p>

<p>Would say that upon having asseverated the present rate of exchange pertainitive to cancelled postage stamps as originally emitted by the Burmese and Canadian Governments. I will accordeonly give you full credence for the respective amount so realized. In the interim, meanwhile, I will open gesticulations for the floating of a moratorium on the uncancelled stamps of identical emission, and will reform you completely as to any eventuations that may perspire.</p>

<p>Thanking you for your generous effort to repudiate your dett at this time.</p>
