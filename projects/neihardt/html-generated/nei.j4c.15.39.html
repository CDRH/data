      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn: </div>
      
      
      <p>I am thoroughly well satisfied with the engagements that you have arranged, and I
         am really glad that there are not more. Dr. LeRossignol has asked me to do something
         at the Banquet of the Writers Guild on Saturday evening, May 2, and I will go there
         directly from Branson. I should think I could get away Sunday, the third, and reach
         Wayne nicely in the evening, but it is barely possible that someone may induce me
         to stay over Sunday, either in Lincoln or in Omaha.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Could you arrange to have me beginning on Tuesday, the fifth? You may count on me
         to do anything you want me to do that I can do. Your suggestion for an informal gathering
         or two in addition to a night affair sounds good. When I leave Wayne, I will drive
         directly to Manderson, South Dakota and shall spend about ten days there. I can go
         over to Chadron anytime during that ten days or immediately afterward on the return
         trip. Counting two days with you and two days for the trip to Manderson, you will
         be able to tell President Elliott when I'm available, and he can drop me a line at
         Manderson, South Dakota, saying when he wants me and I will be on hand, since the
         drive to Chadron is not considerable.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>My two daughters, Enid and Hilda, will accompany me on this trip--Enid as secretary and Hilda as official observer! If arrangements cannot be made to give them a room on the hill, we can no doubt find
         a place nearby or downtown.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am genuinely eager to see you and Mrs. Conn again.</p>
