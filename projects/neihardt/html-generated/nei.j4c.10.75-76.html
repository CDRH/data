      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm genuinely eager to read any parts of your book you care to send. It will be a
         
         <em>real</em> pleasure, and it's good of you to share the joy of making with me. It's undoubtedly
         the greatest joy there is. I have plenty of time, especially this month, as I do not
         expect to be reviewing steadily until January, + I'm not going out on the road until
         the new year.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The "Phoenician" in the Saturday Review says: "I have been tooting the horn for Neihardt's
         Song of the Indian Wars all over the place. It's a grand piece of work". Then he goes
         on to praise Poetic Values, tho' I judge he hadn't yet read at thoroughly. The point
         is that we have an ally in the Sat. Review office. I'm crazy to see your review, which
         should appear soon. - And the New Republic surely there is a reason for Macmillan's
         advertising liberally there. I do want Lovett to go into the stuff with some thoroughness.
         He'd throw some light; and an appreciation of all my epic stuff by him could well
         be issued by Macmillan as a pamphlet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>So already your light is spreading in the new country - as I expected! Bully! You
         seem full of life and eager. Bully again! And O how I want your book to make a good
         splash!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm make fine progress with the 
         <u>Messiah.</u>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Comrade, the world - the real world - contains fewer + fewer people for me; but you
         stay put, and you will not fade away. That is because of the 
         <u>spirit</u> in you.
