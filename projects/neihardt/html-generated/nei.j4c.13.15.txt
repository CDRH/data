      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>It must have been a week ago that I 
         <u>thought</u> a delighted letter to you about the last issue of the Quarterly. Of course, I was
         delighted, not only with the fact that a good share of the issue was devoted to my
         stuff, but because the whole magazine shows a surprising improvement. You are doing
         something worth doing. I should think the College would feel grateful to you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Since I can't write an article specially for the Quarterly now, would you care to
         have a couple already written and, of course, unknown to your readers?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I don't see much vacation this year. I shall have three weeks, as usual, on pay, but
         I have to spend a whole week at Penn State and the going and coming will kill another
         week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Four candidates for degrees, in different parts of the country, are doing theses on
         my stuff this year - so far as I know. Reading (Pa.) High School wants my picture
         
         <del class="for its">for its</del> to hang. Little straws here and there continue to point in a hopeful direction, and
         the sales of the school point in a hopeful direction, and the sales of the school
         editions increase. If anything intelligent could be done by way of pushing the school
         editions, or even giving them half a chance, things would be doing.
      </p>
