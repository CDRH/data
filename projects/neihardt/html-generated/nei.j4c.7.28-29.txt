      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>A bully long letter from you, which I shall answer soon. Just now I have time only
         to say that I'm sending a chap to you and that you needn't spend much time on him.
         He's a hero-worshipper &amp; wants a look at you. Don't scare him, and don't regard him
         as a minister 
         <span class="">[plenipotentiary?]</span> (!) from me — that is, as to my views of things. I like him, however. Be a nice purring
         lion — give him a fine memory, Old Scout!
      </p>

         <br></br>Jno.
          
      </div>
      
      
      
      <p>Got a hell of a sore finger &amp; can scarcely scribble. (Bully swimming + fishin' here
         — love of a place!)
      </p>
      
      <p>Kindest regards to Mrs. T. She does me too much honor.</p>
