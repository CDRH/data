      <p>It's just struck me that Wm R. Bouet, associate Editor of the Literary Review of the
         N.Y. Eve. Post, might want an article on the cycle by you. Perhaps you would care
         to suggest the matter to him.

      <p>I'm one of the three judges for The Poetry Society Prize of 1921. Prof. Erskine of
         Columbia represents the East. Elia W. Peattie, the South; I, The West.
