      <p>I've been thinking of you a good share of the time and wishing there were something
         I could do to help you; but, as usual, when the big needs come one is hard to reach
         with help.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm wondering what you are planning, or may plan. I wish I could be with you. If you
         are to be in Montgomery, as I suppose you will be, I'd like to visit with you, if
         possible.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When I hear from you again and know that you have begun to go ahead again, I will
         send you several letters I want you to see.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was about to write you that you sent the wrong book, which I returned, when your
         note arrived from N. Y.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I 
         <u>want</u> to get at you, but a letter is no good.
      </p>
