      <p>In our High School at Westfield we have been studying your poem, "The Song of Three
         Friends". We are reading it as a classic in American Literature. We had some discussion
         on who was the hero and we are divided as to our opinions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>We would like to know which of the three friends you intended for the hero.</p>

      <p>Would you mind giving these kids your view of the matter that interests them? I'm
         sure you can be for more stimulating than I, and no doubt you've discussed the question
         more than once in classes. In fact, you consider it in 
         <u>Man and Poet</u>, I seem to remember.
