      <p>I received your letter about Alexander while spending a week in Branson, and I wired
         you at once. I hope the telegram reached you and that you may have good luck in getting
         Stepanek and Piper to write for you. They are undoubtedly the ones who should do the
         job. Jim Brittain knows a lot about A's philosophy, and Harvey Newbranch could say
         a lot about the man's many interests and activities. I can't say how much of a philosopher
         A is and I can't become enthusiastic about his verse. But he is a very remarkable
         personality and there's great stuff in him. He is worth a number of your quarterly,

         and, considering everything, I'd say that it's mighty gracious of you to give the
         man a number. Prof. Orin Stepanek may not be at thet U. of Neb. now, but your letter
         will undoubtedly find him somewhere. Stepanek is a really big fellow.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>That last number was a fine one indeed. The steady improvement delights me. You are
         really doing something of genuine value, I'm sure.
