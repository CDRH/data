      <p>I was very sorry indeed that we could not get together while you were in my country.
         When I received your letter from Lyons, the southbound train was just due. So I hastily
         wrote a card, feeling sure that you would get it the same evening. That you did not
         receive it in time must have been due to the negligence of the hotel people. It reached
         Lyons shortly after five o'clock Saturday evening.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Whenever you happen to be in this country, come right along to my house. You will
         be welcome at any time.
      </p>
