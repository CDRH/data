                <p>Here is another item in the case of Pattee against Common Honesty:</p>
                    <p>If the gentleman, far from taking the trouble of reading my Cycle before rendering judgement thereon, had merely looked into the Drinkwater-Canby-Benet anthology of English poetry or, better still, into the Quinn-Bough-Howe work, the Literature of America, he could have learned with little effort how foolish the professorial Greek-imitation charge is. These are only two anthologies (both standard) that he might have consulted.</p>
                
                <p>God damn liars and fools!</p>
