<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p>That last letter to the gentleman is a dandy and I'd hate to receive one like it with equal justification. It will be interesting to see what sort of reply you receive.</p>
                
<p>The idea about an article for PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION sounds good to me, and I do hope you may care to write the other article entitled " The Making of a Myth". Where did you think of publishing the latter? It might not be a bad idea to try SATURDAY REVIEW through William Rose Benet. <div class="note">Or Boston Transcript through the lit. ed. who is a true believer, I gather.</div></p>
                
<p>I suppose you are still having your second spring just as we are here.</p>
                
<p>I'm looking forward to April when Enid, Hilda and I will go up for the pow wows with Black Elk and his friends. Did I tell you that I have signed the contract with Morrow? The manuscript is to be delivered no later than November 31. I'll have it ready before September.</p>
                
<p>Nothing much to say from here just now.</p>

    <span class="salute">With love always,</span>
    <br/>Jno.
