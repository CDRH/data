      <p>That last letter to the gentleman is a dandy and I'd hate to receive one like it with
         equal justification. It will be interesting to see what sort of reply you receive.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The idea about an article for PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION sounds good to me, and I do hope
         you may care to write the other article entitled " The Making of a Myth". Where did
         you think of publishing the latter? It might not be a bad idea to try SATURDAY REVIEW
         through William Rose Benet. 
         <div class="note">Or Boston Transcript through the lit. ed. who is a true believer, I gather.</div>

      <p>I suppose you are still having your second spring just as we are here.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'm looking forward to April when Enid, Hilda and I will go up for the pow wows with
         Black Elk and his friends. Did I tell you that I have signed the contract with Morrow?
         The manuscript is to be delivered no later than November 31. I'll have it ready before
         September.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Nothing much to say from here just now.</p>
