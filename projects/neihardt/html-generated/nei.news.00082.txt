      <p>
         <span class="">[?]</span> physics is a world contemplated from within, surveyed by appliances which are part
         of it and subject to its laws.  What the world might be like if probed in some manner
         by appliances not furnished by itself we do not profess to know.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“We (scientists) are no longer tempted to take up the attitude that everything which
         lacks concreteness is thereby self-condemned.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“ The cleavage between the scientific and nonscientific domain of experience is, I
         believe, not a cleavage between the concrete and transcendental, but between the metrical
         and nonmetrical.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“To put the conclusion crudely — the stuff of the world is mind stuff.</p> 
      
      
      <p>The mind—stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual
         conscious minds: but we may think of its nature as not altogether foreign to the feelings
         in our consciousness.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme
         ultimately derived out of it.  But we must presume that in some other way or aspect
         it can be differentiated into parts.  Only here and there does it rise to the level
         of consciousness, but from such islands proceeds all knowledge.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“We are acquainted with an external world because its fibers run into our consciousness:
         it is only our own ends of the fibers that we actually know; from these ends we more
         or less successfully reconstruct the rest, as a paleontologist reconstructs an extinct
         monster from its footprints.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“Nowadays whenever enthusiasts meet together to discuss theoretical physics, the talk
         sooner or later turns in a certain direction.  You leave them conversing on their
         special problems or the latest discoveries: but return after an hour and it is any
         odds that they will have reached an all-engrossing topic — the desperate state of
         their ignorance.  This is not a 
         <span class="">[?]</span> It is not even scientific modesty, because the attitude is often one of naïve surprise
         that nature should have hidden her fundamental secret successfully from such powerful
         intellects as ours.  It is simply that we have turned a corner in the path of progress
         and our ignorance stands revealed before us appalling and 
         <span class="">[?]</span>. There is something radically wrong with the present fundamental concepttions of
         physics and we do not see how to set it right.”
