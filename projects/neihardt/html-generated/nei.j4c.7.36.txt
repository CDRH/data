      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>Here are three Sterling poems for the Pack. Please see that I get the manuscripts
         back. As you note, they are signed by Sterling. I have a large collection of his signed
         manuscripts and want it to be larger.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You can get the dope for his life-sketch from Who's Who, of course. If Scollard sends
         you one or two poems, rush them to the printer without sending to me.
      </p>

         <div class="salute">Yours, </div>
         
         
         <br></br>J.G.N.
          
      </div>
      
      
      <p>Sterling says in his letter: "It is understood, of course, that the Seymours acquire
         no rights in the poems by using them in the Pack". This is satisfactory to you, no
         doubt.
