      <p>I've just been enjoying your Henry Ford article! Could anything be more delicious
         than the unconscious humor of the Bourgeois mind — or more tragic in its implications?
         I used to be of the impression that the world was run by capable men, as a matter
         of course. Slowly it dawned upon me that comparatively few men ever become intellectual
         adults, and that our world is really run by big children. They will discuss everything
         under the sun but the real question, just as they are doing now

         at Paris. Couldn't a significant article be written on the relation of the sense of
         humor to the revolutionary process? Always the class that supports the moribund system
         seems to be without that sense, while the revolutionary classes have it in abundance.
         When men can no longer see themselves &amp; chuckle at what they are, they seem to be
         lost. Of course, the idea is old, old; but a new appreciation could be made.

      <p>Did you see </p>
      <p>
         <u>The Public</u>
      </p>
      <p> for March 1st? The whole number struck me as being rather funny, and I was seized
         with an itch to kid the editors. Assuming the psychological atmosphere of the Bourgeoisie,
         I wrote

         a rather raw and hasty letter, which I enclose, together with the note I received
         from the editor, Cooley. I had hopes that the Public would print my inquiry, and that
         some benevolent pig-head might undertake to enlighten me! It would have been great
         fun. Nothing doing in the enlightenment business, however! I wasn't quite pig-headed
         enough to get across, it appears.

      <p>Recently I received a book called "Casting Out Fear" by the "Hon. Mrs. Lionel Guest"
         — the richest bit of unconscious humor I have ever seen! I wrote a review of it, and
         of course, it won't

         appear. The "Hon. Mrs." pointed out that fear is all that is wrong with the world,
         and that poverty is unnecessary, even unintelligent(!) because "all share equally
         the time in which to make money!"

      <p>I would like to spend half my time in writing about our Bourgeois literature, seeming
         to take it seriously yet making it appear at least half as ridiculous as it really
         is.

      <p>I've just finished reading a book called "The English Village" in which there is prime
         material for your proposed work on Literature in the "Dead Hand" series. It shows
         how literary criticism in some important instances has been influenced by the economic
         system. Old to you, of course. Nevertheless right in line with your thesis.
