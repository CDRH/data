<span class="salute">Dear Sterling: —</span>

	<p>It has been a long while since I heard from you last, but many things have kept me from writing. Your last letter told how you had refused to become a member of the Institute, &amp; I rejoiced at your stand, for your reasons are good. I had thought, however, that the advertising value of membership might be considerable, and for that reason I was genuinely glad to hear that you had been selected. Of course you do not need the Institute; it could add nothing to you, but it makes a noise, &amp; this is a noisy planet.</p>
	<p>Anyway, congratulations on your admirable display of bowels!</p>

	<p>Do you know Dhan Gopal Mukerji, the young <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Hindu​ ">Hindoo</a>
    ​ Brahmin? He spent Easter Sunday with me, and we had a fine battle!</p>
	<p>The school edition of <u>Glass</u> was sold out by Feb 1st, &amp; is only now reprinting. Rather gratifying to me! My "The Splendid Wayfaring" (prose) will be out for the Fall trade. Am beginning on my "Song of the Indian Wars".</p>
	<p>How are you, Old Man? And do you love me just a little? I wish I could have you alone in some lonesome place for a day. So much to discuss concerning current tendencies!</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I'm off for a scout on several of the old Sioux &amp; Cheyenne battlefields in May. Will lecture at several places by way of paying expenses. Will meet some Indian-chiefsIndian chiefs &amp; scouts who have agreed to give me dope on the old heroic times. They will go to a big ranch out in the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Sandhills​ ">sand hills</a>
    ​, &amp; there we will have a powwow.</p>
