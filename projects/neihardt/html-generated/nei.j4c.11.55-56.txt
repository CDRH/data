      <p>I have been offered the Literary Editorship of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and will
         take charge as soon as I can get away from the Journal-Post of Kansas City - which
         I think will be in less than two weeks. I will use a good deal of contributed material,
         and I am wondering if you might not want to do a review now and then for the Post-Dispatch
         page. I don't know what I shall be able to pay - don't know P-D space rates; but they
         do pay, I understand. It has struck me that a number of us who understand a thing
         or two ought to stick together in trying

      <p>You and Frederick have done and are doing fine things through the Midland. Can't we
         make the Post-Dispatch do something too?
