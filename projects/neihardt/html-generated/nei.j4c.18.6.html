      <p>I am sending you a book on Hitler, which seems important.</p>
      
      
      <p>You will be free to speak out about this, because you will in no way be attacking
         our system. You may have as much as 450 words. Sorry I can't allow more.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I suppose it would be impossible to have the review here by next Tuesday or Wednesday;
         if so, let me have it for the next week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The book should be returned to the Literary Editor, Post-Dispatch, by express collect,
         not using my name. In this way, I will not have to pay the carriage charges.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When the article is printed, you will receive the check.</p>
