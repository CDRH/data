<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>I failed to answer your question regarding an anthology of lyrics for school use. Write Brown about this, giving him your idea as to what such a book should be. All you could expect from him would be assurance that such a book as you have in mind has possibilities from Macmillan's standpoint. That would be much, you could then go ahead. I think the idea bully. Most writers &amp; publishers charge for permission to use material in anthologies. My royalty acount always shows an item of that sort. Here &amp; there an author &amp; publisher would give permission gratis.</p>

<p>The Margery Swett Educational Agency of New York wants to book me for one-week engagements with universities &amp; colleges for lectures on poetry. And I've just tied up with the K.C. Journal-Post! Damn!</p>
