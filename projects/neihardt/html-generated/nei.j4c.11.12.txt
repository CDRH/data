      <p>I failed to answer your question regarding an anthology of lyrics for school use.
         Write Brown about this, giving him your idea as to what such a book should be. All
         you could expect from him would be assurance that such a book as you have in mind
         has possibilities from Macmillan's standpoint. That would be much, you could then
         go ahead. I think the idea bully. Most writers &amp; publishers charge for permission
         to use material in anthologies. My royalty acount always shows an item of that sort.
         Here &amp; there an author &amp; publisher would give permission gratis.

      <p>The Margery Swett Educational Agency of New York wants to book me for one-week engagements
         with universities &amp; colleges for lectures on poetry. And I've just tied up with the
         K.C. Journal-Post! Damn!
