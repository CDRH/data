      <p>Thanks for yours of the 11th. Good news about Rob't Hill of the MSS Room at the N.
         Y. Public Library! He will work. I'm sure. That was a successful affair at the U.
         of Maryland. There is a testimonial on it in the lecture folder I must have given
         you. Henry Holt &amp; Co.'s representative is here now and will visit us out there on
         Sunday. Of course, there is no longer any Holt in the firm, but the rep. can give
         leads. He is excited about 
         <u>Black Elk Speaks</u>; wants his company to republish. We'll see. (The book, when one can be found, brings
         $10 to $15)

      <p>Fine about the Sterling letters! Now if you can find Jackson Barber's MSS (including
         transcripts of all Sterling's letters to me) we'll be in luck. You can find the stuff,
         I'm sure. The Bohemian Club should help.

      <p>About Mrs. Wm. Vaughan Moody. It was shortly before the 2nd World War (maybe in the
         late 30's) that I was invited to her home one Sunday afternoon. She always had important
         guests at her salons on Sundays. When I was there, Lady Kennedy-Fraser and her daughter
         were

         present. Lady K-F was from the Orkneys &amp; was an authority on all things great and
         Gaelic. She had an ancient Gaelic harp, playing her own accompaniments to the ancient
         songs she sang. And what a voice she had — deep, and muffled as tho' tears were going
         down inside! She sang 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Lament for Cuchulain</u>
      </p>
      <p> (one of my most-loved heroes, by the way) and it lifted the hair on my head. She
         was an old lady, 
      </p>
      <p> near seventy.</p>

      <p>Her daughter was coldly beautiful — made me think of a sword. When she sang there
         was battle in her voice. However, the old lady was far more moving. During the afternoon
         Mrs. Moody sat down beside me on a sofa, put her arm across my shoulder and said,
         "I think I am going to love you." And I said, "Please do!" (She, of course, was 
         <u>much</u> older than I.) It was during that afternoon that I last spoke with our late lamented,
         Harriett Monroe.

      <p>She called me by phone and said: "You don't mean you are not coming to see us at 
         <u>Poetry</u> office?" I replied to the effect that I couldn't make it on that trip. I was wrong
         again, for I suspect she was in a mood to kiss and makeup!! Too bad, and I'm sorry.

      <p>Sterling stayed with us at least a day and a night on his 1914 visit. I recall most
         clearly that we went into the country, lay on top of a hay-stack

         and talked about everything. I remember I said to him, incidentally "George, you have
         absolute control over your technique in poetry, and it is all exquisitely beautiful.
         I 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>do</u>
      </p>
      <p> wish you could have the same control over your life." He said he wished the same,
         but somehow he couldn't manage it. That afternoon he told me about some of his escapades,
         and I can see him still rolling in the hay and laughing. When he laughed,

         his ears went back and he looked like a

      <p>"Mrs. T" was, no doubt, Mrs. Travis, wife of the owner of the Yellow Cab Co. at that
         time. Evidently she had said something excessively kind about me. "Great Grandma"
         was

         <u>my</u>
      </p>
      <p> maternal grandmother, Catherine Culler. She was a covered-wagon woman — went to N.
         W. Kansas in the late 70's. I was with my grandfather and grandmother out there when
         I was five and six

         years old. That was in Rooks County, on the upper Solomon River near Stockton. She
         was a fine, strong, noble old woman — bless her! We have a photo of her with Enid
         and Sig staring up at her devotedly.
