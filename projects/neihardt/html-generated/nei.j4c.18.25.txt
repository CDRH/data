                <span class="salute">Dear friends:</span>
                
                <p>I'm sending the manuscript of "Straws". I hope you can read it at once, make your notes, and let me have it back <u>within two weeks</u>. I must have some of the material for reference in preparing a week's seris of lectures before the Des Moines Forum.</p>
                
                <p>I've read the Garland brochure. Compared with yours - what a thin, perfunctory thing it is!</p>
                
                <p>Have you read Poetic Values? If not, you should I can send a copy.</p>
                
                <p>You are doing a real job. Be sure that we are sincerely grateful to you.</p>
                
                <p>I've been making astonishing progress with "Jed Smith" - 10 to 17 lines a day for some weeks! Am stopped now for some lectures; but, barring accident, I should finish in the late summer.</p>
