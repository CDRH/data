      <p>Since writing you last I have bought a place here in the Ozarks overlooking the White
         River, and I expect to stay until I shall have completed my epic cycle of the West.
         The surroundings are very beautiful, and the climate is much milder than in Nebraska.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I have been wondering what progress you have been able to make in the matter of moving
         pictures. A friend of mine in Kansas City has written to a person influential in the
         moving picture world down East, asking that he get in touch with you. I hope this
         has been done.
      </p>
