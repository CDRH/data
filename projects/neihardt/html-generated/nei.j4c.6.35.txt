<span class="salute">My dear Mr. Braithwaite: —</span>


	<p>Since writing you last I have bought a place here in the Ozarks overlooking the White River, and I expect to stay until I shall have completed my epic cycle of the West. The surroundings are very beautiful, and the climate is much milder than in Nebraska.</p>
	<p>I have been wondering what progress you have been able to make in the matter of moving pictures. A friend of mine in Kansas City has written to a person influential in the moving picture world down East, asking that he get in touch with you. I hope this has been done.</p>
