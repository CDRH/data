      <p>Jessie B. Rittenhouse wrote me recently, asking permission to use two of my lyrics
         in her Third Book of Modern Verse soon to appear from Houghton Mifflin Co., and asked
         if I had any new lyrics. I sent the Lindbergh poem and she wrote back in high glee,
         saying that it is "far and away the finest thing on the subject". She also said fine
         things about the cycle, which could not be quote in an anthology such as hers. it
         struck me that she might do an article on Collected Poems for New Republic, and I
         have put this up to her. I think she would be do it, and if she wants to, we can call
         Lovett.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Everything going finely. I have heard from the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, the
         Head of the Educational System in Hawaii and many others about the Lindbergh thing.
         After this year I shall be at work again on the cycle, the stronger for the delay,
         without doubt. I do hope you can get Macmillans interested in the idea of taking you
         on.
