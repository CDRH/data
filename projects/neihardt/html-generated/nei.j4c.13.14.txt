      <p>Have just received the April issue, and am looking forward to a bully time with it.
         I have a really valuable idea to offer, and I am offering it in a hurry between jobs.
         Here it is.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Louis J. Alber, who is arranging a tour for me for the coming season, would doubtless
         be glad for a chance to get a goodly number of copies of this issue to distribute
         in connection with his booking activities. As you may know, his is about the largest
         organization of its kind in America - The Affiliated Lyceum and Chataqua something
         or other - I forgot the exact lingo. Anyway, he has has agents all over the U.S. and
         Canada. Now why wouldn't it be a very good idea to write him, sending a copy of the
         magazine and asking if he could use a hundred or so? I think he could. Address him
         as follows:
         
         Louis J. Alber,
         
         2443 Prospect Ave.,
         
         Cleveland, Ohio.

      <p>More later. Am jumping around.</p>
