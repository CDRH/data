      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Murray: </div>
      
      
      <p>I have read "Provincial Honeymoon" with care, and you will believe that my attitude
         was, and is, one of genuine eagerness for your welfare. I want you to be happy in
         achievement; and what I shall have to say will be prompted by that desire, backed
         by my belief in your ability.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In the first place, you write remarkably well, and I am sure your technique will be
         adequate for anything you may conceive clearly and with enthusiasm. Your understanding
         of character is notable, and you have a gift for presenting your people in a simple
         way that makes them real. In fact, all the way through the book it seemed to me that
         you were remembering, and not creating, these people. The same is true of all the
         incidents. Furthermore, a fine quality of mind and heart is to be felt throughout
         the story.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This is "all to the good" surely--an excellent equipment for the things you are going
         to do.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Nevertheless, the measure of success you have achieved here is not in keeping with
         either your desire or your ability. The fault is not a matter of detail; it is fundamental,
         being a lack in the original conception of the whole. You have a wealth of vividly
         realized character for material, but it lacks purposeful organization. It is not dealt
         with creatively. Life presents an apparent chaos of people and events moving in tune.
         The creative act is that of tracing
         
      </p>

      <h6 class="fw">-2-</h6>
      <h6 class="fw">
         <del class=""></del>11
      </h6>
      <p>
         design in the apparent chaos to the end that the whole may be illuminated with emergent
         meaning.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I feel no patter in your story, 
         <u>no dynamic scheme</u>. This is underlined because it is the vital point. Your characters come and go, do
         this and that. They are all certainly quite recognizable people, and things they do
         are quite as recognizably things they doubtless would or could do. But if verisimilitude
         were enough, there would be no need for creative art. You have made with skill a faithful
         copy of the phase of life you have chosen to record, and it is the obvious you have
         recorded. The meanings that attach to the record are those which you, as author, have
         appended in the form of commentary. I am aware that this method of presenting life
         has been employed with what passes for great success by certain authors in our day;
         but the morbid popular interest in sordid character and scandalous incident was involved
         in such "success". Were your incidents sufficiently shocking, you too could "succeed"
         with such a method. But not one character or incident in the whole book is even slightly
         sensational. To be offensive in any way is not among your gifts--a matter of great
         satisfaction to both of us, I am sure.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Were you one to develop character on a grand scale, your method might seem sufficient;
         but in that case your characters would be conceived in accordance with a very definite
         dynamic scheme, which in turn would give dramatic impulse to the sequence of incidents
         whereby the developing character
         <del class=""></del> would be revealed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There is an inevitable self-completion in the creative process. The creative power
         moves in such a way as to return upon itself. A graph of the creative process would
         approximate a circle. A graph of the movement of your story would be a line with slight
         irregularities, and with perhaps an abrupt upward turn at the end.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I do believe that you will readily grant the justice in this abstract statement of
         my objection to the book. Having done so, you may ask what concrete suggestion I have
         to make. I would say that when you have conceived a theme for another novel, you should
         give

         yourself to dreaming out a plot suitable to the development of that theme; that you
         should continue your dreaming until you feel the whole story complete, and a self-completing,
         within you--not in every detail, but as an architectural mass, much as one might see
         a church, from foundation to spire, looming in a thin fog. When your sense of the
         whole has grown so that to think of it is to feel uplifted and enlarged, then begin
         to write,
