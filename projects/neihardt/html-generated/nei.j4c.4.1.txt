<span class="salute">Dear Sterling:</span>

	<p>I'm planning to get away from Berkeley on Tuesday, March 5th. Thursday P. M., the 7th, I'll take a Pacific S. S. Co. boat for Seattle. Can't we do something together in the intervening time? I hope so. Could we fly down to Monterey Tuesday evening late, stroll around there Wednesday, &amp; get back to S. F fairly early Thursday morning?</p>
	<p>I want to see Monterey — one of my heroes goes there &amp; mixes with the Spanish authorities — and God! but it would be great to go there with you.</p>

<span class="closer">
	<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno.
