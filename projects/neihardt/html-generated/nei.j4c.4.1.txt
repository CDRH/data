      <p>I'm planning to get away from Berkeley on Tuesday, March 5th. Thursday P. M., the
         7th, I'll take a Pacific S. S. Co. boat for Seattle. Can't we do something together
         in the intervening time? I hope so. Could we fly down to Monterey Tuesday evening
         late, stroll around there Wednesday, &amp; get back to S. F fairly early Thursday morning?
      </p>
      	
      <p>I want to see Monterey — one of my heroes goes there &amp; mixes with the Spanish authorities
         — and God! but it would be great to go there with you.
      </p>
