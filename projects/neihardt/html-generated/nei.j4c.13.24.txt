      <p>You dreamed of the letter I should have written and am now writing. I am planning
         to be with you, of course. Have half a notion to 
         <del class="dict">dict</del>ditch the Eastern stunts - it seems too much to undertake, and perhaps I was a fool
         to accept. The fact is, that I am tired all the time and have little energy for anything
         but my grind. And that, I feel, is quite useless, except for the really excellent
         pay. 
         <u>Silence</u> is the only intelligent answer to any of the numerous "questions", "issues" and endless
         blah blah of these times. MY God! It is a damned lunatic asylum and it is getting
         worse steadily. Even intelligent people are fooled - for what chance have they to
         know? Blither, blather, blah, blah! A civilization that thrives on ignorance and shenanigans! Smoke screens, red herrings, and endless lying and four-flushing! If you could spend
         six months in my office in contact with the actual pulse of the world as it is,
         <del class=""></del> you'd want to go into a Trappist monastery. I leave this evening for Iowa University.
         Shall return Sunday. Get $100 
         <u>and expenses</u> for an hour's spouting.
      </p>
