<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>You dreamed of the letter I should have written and am now writing. I am planning to be with you, of course. Have half a notion to <del>dict</del>ditch the Eastern stunts - it seems too much to undertake, and perhaps I was a fool to accept. The fact is, that I am tired all the time and have little energy for anything but my grind. And that, I feel, is quite useless, except for the really excellent pay. <u>Silence</u> is the only intelligent answer to any of the numerous "questions", "issues" and endless blah blah of these times. MY God! It is a damned lunatic asylum and it is getting worse steadily. Even intelligent people are fooled - for what chance have they to know? Blither, blather, blah, blah! A civilization that thrives on ignorance and shenanigans! Smoke screens, red herrings, and endless lying and four-flushing! If you could spend six months in my office in contact with the actual pulse of the world as it is,<del/> you'd want to go into a Trappist monastery. I leave this evening for Iowa University. Shall return Sunday. Get $100 <u>and expenses</u> for an hour's spouting.</p>

<span class="salute">Endless love, dear, dear Comrade.</span>

<br/>Jno.

<p>It's too much, but nothing seems to matter but cash.</p>
