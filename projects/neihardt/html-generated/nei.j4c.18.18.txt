                <p>Of course I want to come to Charleston and see you. If you can manage to have me on a Friday in late March, I'll be ready. But don't take any financial risks yourself. Feel about and find out what you can do and let me know.</p>
                
                <p>Everything goes finely here. Since last evening I am two grandfathers. It's another little girl. Sig and Max rather flirted with the idea of having a boy, but they agree that girls are probably nicer to have.</p>
               
                <p>This carries the old love,</p>
