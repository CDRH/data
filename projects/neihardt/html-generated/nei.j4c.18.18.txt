      <p>Of course I want to come to Charleston and see you. If you can manage to have me on
         a Friday in late March, I'll be ready. But don't take any financial risks yourself.
         Feel about and find out what you can do and let me know.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Everything goes finely here. Since last evening I am two grandfathers. It's another
         little girl. Sig and Max rather flirted with the idea of having a boy, but they agree
         that girls are probably nicer to have.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This carries the old love,</p>
