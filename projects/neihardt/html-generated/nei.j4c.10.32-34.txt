      <div class="salute">Dearest Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>There was a ripe, autumnal beauty in your farewell letter from Wayne. It would have
         made me very sad if I had not known that distance is pretty much a bluff, and that
         you will experience a new springtime in your new home. There will be so many fine
         things to do; and as soon as that enthusiasm of yours gets stirred up, everything
         will be all right again. How fine to leave a place, after twelve years, with such
         genuine approval! I'm so eager to hear all about the new college and your plans. You
         can't write much until after things get going, I know; but it will be great to hear
         just as soon as you have time to write.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Little by little the details of the great day at Wayne have been coming in, and we
         have a pretty vivid picture of the whole thing now. Your letter added much, and yesterday
         we received the large photo of the monument. With a reading glass I could make out
         the whole inscription, which the papers I have seen did not give in full. The wording
         is august, worthy of bronze. The whole affair seems incredible, almost.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm glad you and Judge had a chance to get acquainted. And it's fine to know that
         you do like each other. Judge was deeply impressed, and he rather outraged his Scotchiness
         in expressing what he felt about you. Of course it would be fine if he were right
         about the new book; but I'm not convinced. I do believe that there is a key idea in
         the little book, but I'd rather have written the WARS, if I were forced to choose.
         And I'd rather write the MESSIAH than any 
      </p>
      <p> prose book. I could write

         When you read POETIC VALUES, I want your honest-to-goodness opinion. You wouldn't
         say what you didn't believe, but you might say less. The get-up of the book will be
         pleasing. Macmillans have sent me sample pages. It will be an odd size, larger than
         a 12mo and squareish, with a liberal page. There should be around 150 pages. The Judge
         has not heard any of the book, and he may be disappointed. Still, in some recent letters
         I was called upon to make some comments on Schweitzer's Civilization and Ethics, that
         the Judge loaned me, and he was all for what I had to say; so it is possible that
         he may not be disappointed. Then, too, we've had a number of nights together at his
         flat, and I've always turned loose on him and he on me. He tries to believe that he
         is a materialist, and he isn't by about seventeen light years! I'm a materialist too,
         for that matter; but I'm more, a whole lot more. I'm a synthetic realist, I guess.
         But I don't think the name matters much. The fact behind the name matters tremendously.
         I'm a poet, and I have no notion of being or seeming anything else. Certainly I don't
         want to monkey with formal philosophy. On occasion, I'll fight for our values, as
         I can; and that is all I've done in the new book.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mama seems a bit dazed yet. it has been a glorious dream to her. I can't tell you
         how glad I am that she was there. The whole thing worked out just right. Such poetic
         justice seldom comes to mothers; and there are many mothers who have as much trouble
         to remember as mama has. I don't see how life can hurt her much hereafter.

         <u>I do love you, Comrade.</u>

         somehow?
