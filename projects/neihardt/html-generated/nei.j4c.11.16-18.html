      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I've been, &amp; still am, working 
         <del class=""></del> at high pressure, as I haven't done since my first year on the Minneapolis Journal.
         I've done three weekly installments for the K.C. Journal-Post and the first appeared
         last Sunday (the 7th). The response has been more than I expected so soon. The Sunday
         Ed. says he 
         <del class=""></del>hears "much admiring comment", &amp; one chap wrote a letter to the Journal-Post, chortling
         with joy. Among other things he said: "If Neihardt can keep up this pace, his reviews
         &amp; comment are destined to become a distinct contribution to the culture of the middle
         west" etc.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It looks good now.</p>
      
      
      <p>I suppose you sent your 300 word article to Latham. I hope he will use it with what
         I sent. The whole business would make powerful propoganda - your explanatory article
         with the appreciations.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Golly! How I do hope you may be with Macmillans in two years! You'd like it. &amp; you
         could do a lot of good. It's great to think about. I wish that damned Pulitzer Prize
         would go where it belongs this year! Then so much would be made easy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, Mary 
         <u>is</u> "some kid", as you say. We're all glad to hear of her having gotten what she wants.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>We are up in the air, as to moving and all that. Can't know much yet. But we'll hardly
         be here another winter. I love these hills, though, &amp; shall miss them. Sig is making
         rapid progress in music - plays like the dickens, really: there's a devouring flame
         in him. He might arrive, &amp; at any rate he must have a strong teacher soon. 
         
      </p>

      <p>
         Enid too is making good progress. She's less brilliant in music than Sig, whose hands
         seem to know more than they should; but Enid is very steady &amp; sure, &amp; her playing
         is like her character. Sig is a flame in a high wind or nothing. The little devil
         dreams music, &amp; all his consciousness is colored with the one intention. He said the
         other day: "Daddy, I want to go where all the people around me will be fools for music!"
         He's not "heady" at all. There's a very obvious humility about him whenever big things
         are to be considered. He heard Percy Grainger at Springfield lately, &amp; since then
         he has made more rapid progress than ever.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>300 lines on The 
         <u>Messiah.</u> You bet you are to see it. Nothing prevents now but the task of typewriting. Enid
         is studying typing with an expert here - the touch system - &amp; she swears she'll be
         my secretary. Hasten the day! The damned machine always did get my goat.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Why can't you say more about the Book? I want to know. But, of course, I've been away
         from you so long that you probably wouldn't know where to begin.
