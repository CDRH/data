      <p>About 10 days ago McAdams wrote again, asking for more information &amp; saying he was
         taking the matter up with Pulitzer. You see, I've had no supervision save at very
         long intervals and only from J. P. himself. So there's no one at the P-D now who can
         decide. I doubt if anywhere in America there is another newspaper writer in my position,
         at least not in the editorial realm.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I 
         <u>do</u> hope for an early &amp; favorable decision. Mary is right, I'm sure. I can not send a
         bunch of books, as this is the dull season &amp; most of the stuff is foolish with the
         heat.
