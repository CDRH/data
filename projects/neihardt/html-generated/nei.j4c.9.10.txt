      <div class="salute">Dear Seymours:- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I am scheduled to arrive in Chicago, via Burlington, at 3:59 P.M., October 31st. Must
         leave next morning. Of course I want to see you; but I shall be nearly worn out, as
         I shall have had eight engagements in ten days with constant travelling. Expect to
         be very dull. These trips do terrible things to me.

      <p> I wouldn't want to see you at all under the circumstances if I did not feel something
         homey about you. This is my best compliment, and a sincere one. Mr. Long writes that
         you might want to have some Bookfellows in. I'd like that too, if it could be an off-hand
         affair.
