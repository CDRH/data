<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>


<p>I have a lecture on "Poetry and its Place in Education" that I gave before the Nebraska State Teachers' Association two years ago. Since then I have read it at a number of colleges and universities of the West. I have had extraordinarily good success with it, and wherever I have given it many have asked where it could be gotten in print. Dr. A. W. Small of Chicago University took it for the American Journal of Sociology over a year ago, but it has not yet appeared, though I am told it will probably be used soon.</p>

<p>It has struck me that the Bookfellows might want to issue it. I supposed that Macmillans would bring it out if I cared to offer it, but the thought of giving it to the Bookfellows is rather pleasing to me. It contains 8,000 words.</p>

<p>Do you see anything in the suggestion?</p>

<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. Neihardt

<p>I tried to pack into an hour's talk some of the things I have thought about poetry during a quarter of a century of devotion to the subject.</p>


<div class="note">You ask if there's any book on your "list" I want. I am a book-glutton, and I always take them when offered. Make it a copy of your "<u>Adventures</u> etc."</div>
