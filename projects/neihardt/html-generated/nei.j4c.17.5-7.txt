      St. Louis, Missouri
      
      
      
      <div class="salute">My dear Mr. Parker: </div>
      
      
      <p>I have read "Feet of Clay" several times and I 
         <del class=""></del> like it, in spite of certain objections that I must raise.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You will understand that there could be no advantage to me in speaking to you without
         perfect sincerity.
         <del class=" and you will not suspect that I feel myself under the least obligation to please you. As a matter of [?]"> and you will not suspect that I feel myself under the least obligation to please
            you. As a matter of 
         </del> Although I have read a great number of manuscripts that have been thrust upon me, giving
         my opinions thereon, I have not until now accepted any fee for doing so. When your
         letter arrived, I had come to feel that I should protect myself by charging for my
         services, and it happened that you were the first to be affected by my decision. I
         am really not concerned with making money in this way.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You write extraordinarily well, and you would write better if you did not try so hard.
         I mean by this that you over
         <del class=""></del>stress your emphases. In your letter accompanying the manuscript you state that the
         opening chapter is 
         <del class="[given over?]">given over</del>devoted to "an attempt to create atmosphere by means of place description." This is proper:
         but you use too much time in creating the atmosphere. It should be done with much
         greater economy.
         <del class="and I am sure that two paragraphs would be enough for your purpose">and I am sure that two paragraphs would be enough for your purpose</del>. The chief difficulty that you must overcome is over-writing. You have not yet thought
         of words as though you were obliged to buy them at a dollar apiece (or maybe ten dollars,
         since I do not know what your "purchasing power" may be). The introductory portion of this story is too long, for what you have to tell is not the substance of a novel
         <del class=""></del>ette, but of a short story, and with your present method you have too much portico for
         the house. I mean this in the most kindly way, for it is a fact that you have a genuine
         gift for writing.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>On page four there is an especially striking </p>
      <p>
         <del class="evidence">evidence</del>
      </p>
      <p>example of your tendency to over</p>
      <p>write, when</p>
      <p> you say "where </p>
      <p>
         <u>Quietude</u>
      </p>
      <p> held her </p>
      <p>
         <u>peaceful</u>
      </p>
      <p> dominion". Clearly the adjective was used without careful consideration. You wasted
         it, and you waste many words.

         Why do so? They are costly. In attempting to describe anything you should set yourself
         the problem of presenting a clear picture with the greatest possible verbal economy.
         The power of writing is more in the clearness of the original conception than in the
         words, and you should spend so much time on the conception that few words will suffice
         to make clear what you want to convey.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you will go through this story, keeping in mind this chief fundamental criticism
         of your method, I am sure that you will be able to cut the story down considerably
         in length, and by doing so, you will not detract from the resultant power of it; on
         the contrary, you will increase that power greatly. Many writers have too little language
         power for their purposes. Your difficulty is that you have too much--and use it. Don't
         write up to your capacity. Always try to keep a margin of reserve, for 
         <del class=""></del> power is in the margin.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was genuinely interested in your scheme for the story as outlined in your letter.
         You go at the matter of building a story in the right way, but you do not altogether
         achieve the end
         <del class=""></del> you seek. The ending of your story is cleverly conceived,
         <del class=""></del> but the power of your conception does not reach the reader. It is good strategy to
         leave as much to suggestion as possible, but the author should be careful that the
         suggestion really suggests to the average reader, and your suggestion does not do
         this. I get what you mean in your denouement, but I have the advantage of your own
         explanation and perhaps of a literary experience not common to the general public.
         I was expecting you to do something clever at the end, and as I read I was helping
         you to create that ending. I was, in fact, your enthusiastic ally, for I wanted you
         to succeed.
         <del class="in making a powerful [climax?] But I am not the average reader[?]">in making a powerful climax But I am not the average reader</del> I am sure that you will have to re-write that ending, introducing the sort of suggestion
         that will enable the average reader to know the relationships of the various actors
         in the tragedy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You really have an excellent story here; 
         <del class=""></del>but it is over-told in the main and under-told at the 
         <del class="climax">climax</del>end. More economy in the body of the story and more care in the preparation of the denouement
         <del class=""></del> will make this story excellent.
