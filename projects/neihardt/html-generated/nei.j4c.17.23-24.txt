      <p>Bully to hear from you again! If I have seemed less than friendly, it was only seeming.
         I've been soused in my work and very happy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Tell the young lady, please, that she should not complete her thesis before July,
         when she could have a proof of The Song of the Messiah to study. It will appear in
         September. Just now I'm doing the few last lines. I'm grateful
      </p>
