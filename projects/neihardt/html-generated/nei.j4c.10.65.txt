      <p>You may tell the beautiful young lady that it is plain I wrote for her, though doubtless
         she was inborn when most of The Quest was written. May her life be rich in beauty,
         even to sadness!

      <p>I know practically nothing of the plans for the proposed magazine. It is to be a second
         Midland, evidently, and no doubt there'll be a board of editors. Alexander will be
         sure to loom large on the staff. I wish you could be in such a position.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Why not write Amy Loveman, asking about your article? I take The Sat. Review.</p>
