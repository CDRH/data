<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>You may tell the beautiful young lady that it is plain I wrote for her, though doubtless she was inborn when most of The Quest was written. May her life be rich in beauty, even to sadness!</p>

<p>I know practically nothing of the plans for the proposed magazine. It is to be a second Midland, evidently, and no doubt there'll be a board of editors. Alexander will be sure to loom large on the staff. I wish you could be in such a position.</p>

<p>Why not write Amy Loveman, asking about your article? I take The Sat. Review.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute"><u>Yes I do love you.</u></span>

<br/>Jno.
