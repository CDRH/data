      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour: </div>
      
      
      <p>I think it's a swell idea to ask Masefield, and I should think he'd be nice about
         it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As for the Anthology, use my "Easter" from "Collected Poems".</p>
      
      
      <p>I finished 
         <u>The Song of Jed Smith</u> on April 16th, and the book is to appear in September. So the Cycle of the West is
         completed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm staying awhile at 9917 Emerson Ave., Overland, Missouri (suburb of St. Louis).</p>
