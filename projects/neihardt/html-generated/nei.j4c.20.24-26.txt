      <div class="salute">Dear Friends: </div>
      
      
      <p>Well, I'm here again — with precious memories and a heartful of thankfulness. I have
         seldom been as happy outside my own home as I was in yours. Mona 
         <div class="note">(his wife)</div> has heard all about you, and she shares in my affectionate thoughts of you two dear
         people.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mona opened the surprise envelope, and it 
         <u>was</u> a surprise truly — quite pleasing in the worldly sense, of course, but appreciated
         more as a further expression of your kindness, Slade, for I know it was your doing.
         Many thanks!
      </p>

      <p>I was rather weary when I reached home Sunday evening. It's a long, long wait in St.
         Louis and the station seats 
         <u>are</u> hard. But I rested on Monday and was ready for my Tuesday classes. During my absence,
         Nita, Mona decorated half of the house at least — and 
         <u>what</u> a difference! I don't know how she did it all in so short a time. I mention this
         because you spoke of going after your home in the same way.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I think often of Dr. Thompson, and I hope I may see him again in this world. Please
         tell our lexicographer friend that I am sorry I could have no good talk with him,
         for I 
         <u>did</u> feel something special about him too. They were all fine, the men I met.

      <p>Do let me know about 
         <u>the Book's</u> adventures among publishers. How I 
         <u>do</u> want to see it in print. As I think of it, I have a 
         <u>good feeling</u> with no back thoughts. It is so reasonable, so well-ordered; and it places no burden
         upon normal credulity, arouses no antagonism. Also it 
         <u>flows</u> along with no shocks, and ends in a quiet 
         <del class=""></del> beauty.

      <p>Yesterday was a stifling hot day. Some youngsters fainted in crowded schoolrooms.
         Today is quite cool. What strange weather — upset just as man's world is! We need
         rain again.
