      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn: </div>
      
      
      <p>Your letter of the 2nd reached me just after I mailed my note of this morning. I think
         your plan the better one, and we will let the matter go until October.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have been working harder than usual as the result of my absence on a lecture trip
         for three weeks, and lately I was obliged to lose more time on a trip to St. Louis.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I do not know where I shall be this winter. I may be in Lincoln and I may be in St.
         Louis; but wherever I may be, I can arrange a trip to Wayne, no doubt.
      </p>
