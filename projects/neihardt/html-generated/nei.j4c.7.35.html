      <p>Yes, I'm here!</p>
      
      
      <p>Send on the PACK together with the skeleton for the Introduction. I'll get the proofs
         back to you in a hurry.

      <p>Tell me truly — do you want the Poetry lecture? I was officially crowned at Lincoln
         on June 18th, and used the lecture as my response to the official notification speech.
         It really made a splash. You might issue it as the Laureate address! The whole affair
         was dignified and there was lots of enthusiasm. Before I left a committee from the
         University waited on me and asked if I would make my home in Lincoln a part of the
         year for a salary without duties. This last is, of course, not to be made public yet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I hope you are just as hot and not a bit hotter than I am at this moment. However,
         I know where there is a crystal swimming hole with a pebble bottom and a big tree
         hanging over it — the sort that looks as though somebody had gotten it out of his
         imagination. And the road leading to it runs through a forest of walnut and hickory.
         It's four o'clock and my children are reminding me that it's time to go there.
