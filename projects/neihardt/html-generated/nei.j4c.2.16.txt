      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Chapman:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>The books for which I asked came yesterday, and I am very grateful to you for your
         generous response to my letter. So far I have merely dipped into "Causes and Consequences",
         and I have felt in it the same sure-headedness, the same grasp of facts and the same
         fine vision that stirred me in reading "Learning and Other Essays". I shall have a
         truly delightful time in preparing that article!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You were very kind to ask me to stay at your home when I go East again; and when it
         is possible I shall certainly do so.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You mention having sent for some of my books. If "The Stranger at the Gate" was not
         in your order, I should like to send a copy — or any other that you think might interest
         you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>With all good thoughts,</p>
      
      <div class="closer">
         
         <div class="salute">Yours, </div>
         
         
         <br></br>Jno. G. Neihardt
