      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>It was very good to hear from you again and to feel the warm glow in you.</p>
      
      
      <p>There is so much to say, because of the years we have been apart, that there seems
         to be no place to begin. We should be together a month or more in some lonely place.
         But I love you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>By now the copy of The Messiah I ordered for you must have arrived.</p>
      
      
      <p>I like what you had to say in the latest number of the Outpost — 
         <u>particularly</u> one of the book reviews. It's good to hear that Homer is about to publish a volume
         of verse. I want a copy for review.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In company with a Salt Lake City friend (who is </p>
      <p>
         <u>the</u>
      </p>
      <p> authority on the history of that country) I plan to cross the Great Salt Desert </p>
      <p>
         <u>with horses</u>
      </p>
      <p> next summer. No one has crossed with animals for 90 years. It will be a fine experience.
         Jed Smith crossed the narrower southern portion &amp; nearly died. We can make it nicely
         with our plan. They say that the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>silence</u>
      </p>
      <p> and emptiness 
         
         
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">29</h6>
      <p>
         in the middle of that white desert are something to experience! No native, I'm told,
         could be hired to go out there on a horse. I'm very eager for the adventure.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am now through with the Great Plains country — at last. When I crossed the Divide
         last August, I could say truly — and did — that I was crossing a divide in my life
         interest. Hereafter my "spiritual center of gravity" is out there, insofar as that
         center can truthfully be given 
         <u>any</u> geographical location.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Well, here's the old abiding affection, dear good Comrade!</p>
