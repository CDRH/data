      <h3>Old-Fashioned Satire</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>THE GREAT ENLIGHTENMENT.</em> By Lee Wilson Dodd (Harpers).
      </h4>
      
      <p>FOR some years now it has been the height of fashion to be nothing if not ironical,
         and there is some reason for suspecting that Time, being a gentleman, as the Chinese
         say, may decide that our more “advanced” critics of life have succeeded pretty well
         in being both.  Already there are indications that even our own day may be growing
         a little weary of the fad for disillusionment, and it seems probable that good old
         honest satire in the interest of fundamental sanity may come into rouge.  Surely there
         never was a more propitious moment for such a revival, for could there be any greater
         illusion than the prevailing persuasion to the effect that at last we have become
         disillusioned, since we have been through human nature and the cosmos with our strictly
         scientific lanterns?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>May there not be some hope in the fact that during the present publishing season two
         poets of extraordinary powers have published extended satirical poems of the sort
         indicated, both of which bid fair to reach a large public?  The first of these is
         Leonard Bacon’s “The Legend of Quincibald” and the second is listed above.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In “The Great Enligtenment” Lee Wilson Dodd, a veteran poet, distinctly undervalued
         thus far, considers much of the more loudly touted through that passes in our moment
         as profound, and takes some vigorous sideswipes at certain of our more conspicuous
         social phenomena.  Something of the poem’s mood and purpose may be gathered from the
         author’s “Preliminary Blurb.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“It was all very fitting, as it was unexpectedly profitable,” writes Mr. Dodd, “for
         Mr. Durant to write his spirited studies of outmoded philosophers, but what is needed
         here and now is the story of philosophy a la mode.  And not merely of philosophy,
         but ofscience, religion, and literature a la mode – the wisdom of yesterday [ ? ight
         ] being, in this era of progress, but the foolishness of tomorrow come Thursday. 
         What the modern reader should want and, as I believe, does want, or may at the very
         least through the subtleties of advertising be induced to want in some account (in
         simple but accurate terms, suited to the apprehension of hard-boiled virgins, culture-seeking
         pugilists, retired movie stars, or the legislators of triumphant plutocracy), of the
         best, because latest, thoughts of our best, because latest, thinkers.  Why, for example,
         bother about Plato?  He has been dead far too long to be really important.  He had
         his day, and his day is over.  Or why read Milton, when one can read all the Sitwells?
         But can one?”

      <p>The following passages, addressed to the spirit of Alexander Pope, are typical:</p>
