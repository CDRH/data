      <p>I had hesitated about using your first names, out of an 
         <u>old-fashioned habit of respect</u>, which I knew all along was only 
         <del class=""></del> taboo of my boyhood. Now I use them as a new way of saying that I love you both, separately and together.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I need not tell you how I appreciate your goodness. You know. Lucile, when you wrote
         months ago that Mona made you think of carnations, something hit me where I love.
         It meant too much to me. For a long while

         before her illness Mona was quietly preparing for the great change, and I knew it.
         She would insist upon boxes and barrels of papers and trinkets being looked through
         so that if she should go, there would be no clutter to dispose of. She urged me to
         have family rings mended or reset, since they would be for the children. (She has
         many beautiful things in ivory, amber, jade, sapphire, gold that I collected for her
         during years.) Often she spoke of going on, but never morbidly. And quite often she

         gave me orders about a funeral — no flowers, no minister, cremation. And I was to
         speak reading three lyrics that meant much to her —

         <u>did not obey her orders about flowers</u>
      </p>
      <p>; I never saw so many &amp; so beautiful at a funeral. I wanted a minister out of respect
         for the deep-seated customs of her community, and I had Dr. Lemmon, an old

         <u>directly to her</u>

      <p> for five minutes, reading the lyrics she wanted. I know she heard. Then, best of

      <p>The funeral was last Sunday. Yesterday (Tuesday) I conducted my classes, with a new
         feeling of power that is not mine. I fancied Mona in a back seat (where you, Lucile,
         used to sit) listening to me with that transfiguring radiance breaking through. Do
         you remember that look? And I felt strong, altho'
