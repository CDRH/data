      <p>Hilda plans to get away next week, and she will reach Chicago in the afternoon of
         Wednesday or Thursday. She will phone you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It's dear and characteristic of you to have Hilda. I know how she will feel about
         you two, and I do think you'll like her.
