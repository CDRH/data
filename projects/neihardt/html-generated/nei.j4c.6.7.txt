      <p>"The Brass Check" is terrific. I do hope they won't make you the victim of a frame-up.
         I'm a bit worried for you. Lord! What courage you have! And what a work you are doing!
      </p>
      	
      <p>I can distribute a dozen copies here at once, but I haven't the cash to send in advance.
         Send me a dozen in cloth, and I'll remit within a week after receipt. I'll probably
         be able to handle more later. This thing must get to the people.
      </p>
