<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
   
<p>It has just struck me that you are very likely to be in New York, since Mary will be going there soon. If you do go there, would it not be a good thing for you to have a seance with Mr. Latham and Dr. Brown regarding a connection with Macmillans when you are ready to make it? So much more can be done by talk then by letter, and I am sure you would be persuasive. This was brought up once, and as I remember it, Latham thought the suggestion was "feasible". Golly! With you travelling for Macmillans, great things could be done! Before that time you would have the "Man and Poet" ready.</p>

<p>Everything going finely.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Endless love!</span>

<br/>Jno.
