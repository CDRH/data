      <div class="salute">Dear Mott: </div>
      
      
      <p>Thank you for the clippings. I had seen only the stuff in the Des Moines papers. Also,
         I want to thank you for your introduction that night. I was very sorry that you couldn't
         stay. I wanted a real talk with you very much.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was greatly dissatisfied with my voice at Des Moines, for I struggled with a frog
         in my throat all evening. Then, too, the room was very poor for speaking, &amp; the crowd
         close about me dulled sound. So I was surprised to hear from several sources that
         the impression was good.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>At Indianola it was very different. My voice was quite clear, and the auditorium there
         is good.

         I felt half gagged in the Younkers Tea Room, free and easy in the Simpson auditorium.
         It isn't in the least a matter of nervousness, for I've never felt nervous before
         a crowd. Even if the audience should seem against me, I'm sure I couldn't feel nervous.
         I'd feel defiant then, audacious. Luckily, I've never had an audience that showed
         the least discourtesy. They've always been good to me.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Since you were responsible for my appearance at both these places, I'm glad indeed
         to know that I seem not to have betrayed you.
      </p>
