      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn: </div>
      
      
      <p>I have been invited to speak before several sections of the Minnesota Education Association
         at St. Paul on October 28, and it is desirable that I should have several other engagements
         in the North during late October or early November. Will you please tell me when and
         where the Nebraska Association will meet and give me the name and address of the Secretary?
         Also, will you please tell me during what month of the summer your county institutes
         meet and what seems to you the possibility of my arranging engagements with a number
         of these? I have thought of this in connection with another visit to the 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglalas​ ">Ogalalas</a>
         ​ which I hope to make sometime this summer. BLACK ELK SPEAKS has had a very remarkable
         reception from the press all over the country, but it is too soon to know about the
         sales. There seems to be some possibility that Morrow's Hollywood agent may interest
         the movie people in the book, and at his request I have recently prepared a synopsis
         
         <del class=""></del> showing how the story may be furnished with the necessary popular romantic element
         without falsification. But I'm not counting the hatch in advance.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Macmillan Company has offered me a contract for THE SONG OF THE MESSIAH (which
         cannot be completed short of a year at best) with the proviso that it shall be my
         next book and that the next thereafter shall go to them. Just now we are wrangling
         over the amount to be advanced in cash. I'm not sure that I should tie myself up in
         this way.
      </p>
