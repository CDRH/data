      <p>The October number seems to me a very good thing and I congratulate you again. Yes,
         I do like the articles on my stuff and am grateful. I wish I knew how to be encouraging
         in the matter of bringing the magazine to St. Louis. I maintain something of the status
         of a recluse in this town, much to the bewilderment of the many who have tried and
         tried and tried to make me mix. 
      </p>
      <p> One result is that I know little of the town and have made no powerful connections
         in a personal way. The other and very desirable result is that what I have to say
         in my column

      <h6 class="fw">64</h6>
      <p>
         exerts a rather surprising influence, and no one ever even ventures to "call me down"
         though God knows I am not saying the expected thing. I note that a new "Mirror" has
         just been launched here. It

      <p>
         <del class="and">and</del>
      </p>
      <p>, but I have no notion that it can ever justify its name, considering Wm. Marion Reedy's
         record with the old Mirror
      </p>
      <p>. It is devoted to boosting St. Louis while striving to be a literary mag. I doubt
         if it has solid backing, and it may die soon. This is an intensely materialistic burg,
         and I can't feel that the chances for prying anybody loose from his money

      <p> for a literary project are very good. Perhaps if you could visit here with me you
         could stir something up.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This is done rapidly but it 
         <del class=""></del> bears love, as you know without being told.
