      <p>I wrote you late last night. Got to thumbing about you after I went to bed, and got
         up to write you. It was nearly midnight. I didn't get much said, and I'm looking forward
         to the visit
         <del class=""></del> when we shall be able to talk again. I want to know all about The Book that you can
         tell me, and I am deeply interested in what you have said. Few things would give me
         more joy than that your book should be reasonably successful. I am very eager about
         it. So many books by mere dubs! Why should not the thought of many years bear print
         for you and others? I have faith in what you have been doing. If Macmillans take it
         - bully! But if they don't, then there are other and more driving publishers.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am as eager as ever, too, about the new "Man and Poet". Today I received a letter
         from the National Cyclopedia of American Biography asking for a lot of detailed information
         for a revision of my biography in that publication. I had considerable space in last
         year's issue. Things move slowly but surely. The big Chicago radio station wants me
         to go up their and broadcast something. Boni + Liverright want me to do the chapter
         on Cooper in their "Writers History of American Lit" - etc etc.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It's time for "Man + Poet" in 1927, I'd say.</p>
      
      
      <p>As yet. I'm too crowded to write on the Messiah, but shall soon

         This is largely an

      <p> job. I write only about 2 cols. Per week; but I have a lot to look after, as I attend
         to every detail of the page, type selection, makeup (which is some puzzle at times)
         and everything else. If Pulitzer will let me work out my

      <p>, for I would be using the intelligence of the West. Many are eager to write for me
         + keep in my scheme. I doubt if young, Pulitzer is very intelligent, I don't mean
         he is 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>unintelligent</u>
      </p>
      <p>. He isn't, of course; and he is a very agreeable gentleman, I'm told; but I think,
         from what I know, that he has not his Dad's creative fire. He doesn't need it, for
         that matter, for the P-D is a marvellous organism with tremendous impetus. God! What
         a newspaper. It has been publishing the largest 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>daily</u>
      </p>
      <p> editions in the world lately, and it has distinction. The P-D crowd (1200) seems
         to adore the sheet. There's a fine spirit throughout the building — wonderful team-play
         and loyalty.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Well — more talk; but damn it, it seems to do no good at this distance.</p>
