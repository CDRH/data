                <p>It's a sad story about the missing House letters. I never got around to doing anything with them. All I remember is that I had some intention of going through them to see what I could find of value. They were left in the box as shipped to me — not a large box. When we returned from St. Louis to live again in Branson, the truck was wrecked and we lost much — most of the furniture and some valuables. The moving company came through after some industrious prodding, but some things could not be replaced. For instance, the petition signed by

                   <del>all <span class="unclear ">[?]</span></del> members of the Order of the Indian Wars of the U. S., <del/> urging the amendment of the Order's constitution that I ( a civilian) might become a member, was lost. General Miles was at the head of the Order, and a score or more of the great old Indian fighters signed with him. I'd give a finger or two to have that petition! I suspect the House letters went the same way. They certainly evaporated somehow. Still, you have enough to serve your purpose.</p>
               
                    <p>Some effort should be made to locate letters I wrote to Judge D. M. Vinsonhaler of Omaha

                    during the whole period in which the <u>Indian Wars</u> was being written. The Judge was a dear friend, but as I think I told you, he went strange, not to say "queer", when <u>The Messiah</u> came out, and <u>Jed Smith</u> finished him as a friend, altho' my feeling remained the same. It was a pathetic and comical business! Judge was <u>sure</u> (O so sure!) of his naive materialism! Bless his soul! I love him yet, as we all do. The letters to him would follow

                    the development of the <u>Wars</u> pretty much step by step. His daughter, I believe, is still living in Omaha. I forget her name, but someone at the World-Herald should know about the Judge's affairs.</p>
                
                <p>A Mrs. Travis, wife of the one-time<del/> owner of the Yellow Cab system in San Francisco, should know about Jackson Barber. How to find her? Maybe she is with the angels by now!!</p>
                
                <p>Fine that you will examine the old Minn. Journal files!</p>
