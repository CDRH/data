      <p>It's a sad story about the missing House letters. I never got around to doing anything
         with them. All I remember is that I had some intention of going through them to see
         what I could find of value. They were left in the box as shipped to me — not a large
         box. When we returned from St. Louis to live again in Branson, the truck was wrecked
         and we lost much — most of the furniture and some valuables. The moving company came
         through after some industrious prodding, but some things could not be replaced. For
         instance, the petition signed by

      <p> members of the Order of the Indian Wars of the U. S., </p>
      <p> urging the amendment of the Order's constitution that I ( a civilian) might become
         a member, was lost. General Miles was at the head of the Order, and a score or more
         of the great old Indian fighters signed with him. I'd give a finger or two to have
         that petition! I suspect the House letters went the same way. They certainly evaporated
         somehow. Still, you have enough to serve your purpose.

      <p>Some effort should be made to locate letters I wrote to Judge D. M. Vinsonhaler of
         Omaha

      </p>

         <u>Indian Wars</u>
      </p>
      <p> was being written. The Judge was a dear friend, but as I think I told you, he went
         strange, not to say "queer", when 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>The Messiah</u>

      <p> came out, and </p>
      <p>
         <u>Jed Smith</u>
      </p>
      <p> finished him as a friend, altho' my feeling remained the same. It was a pathetic
         and comical business! Judge was 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>sure</u>
      </p>
      <p> (O so sure!) of his naive materialism! Bless his soul! I love him yet, as we all
         do. The letters to him would follow

      <p> pretty much step by step. His daughter, I believe, is still living in Omaha. I forget
         her name, but someone at the World-Herald should know about the Judge's affairs.

      <p>A Mrs. Travis, wife of the one-time
         <del class=""></del> owner of the Yellow Cab system in San Francisco, should know about Jackson Barber.
         How to find her? Maybe she is with the angels by now!!

      <p>Fine that you will examine the old Minn. Journal files!</p>
      
      
      <p>It will be a pleasure to see you and the Doctor again at Xmas.</p>
