      <p>Shortly before his death, my 
         <del class=""></del> friend Dr. W. E. Sealock, wrote you a letter in which he set forth his 
         <del class="side of the [controversy with?]">side of the controversy with</del> side of the trouble with the Board of Regents of the University of Omaha. 
         <del class="After [his?] Dr. Sealock's">After his Dr. Sealock's</del>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>After his death, as you are doubtless aware, the Board finally issued 
         <del class="a statement [?]">a statement </del> a statement by way of "explaining" its action. I 
         <u>am</u> one of those who know that the statement was absurd &amp; tragically unfair, and I am
         writing to 
         <del class="[ask?] if Dr. Sealock's">ask if Dr. Sealock's</del> suggest that Dr. Sealock's statement to you be 
         <del class="made">made</del> given to the public. 
         <del class="Recently, my paper, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, wired Mrs. Sealock asking for a copy of the statement but, of course, it could not be given. Omaha">Recently, my paper, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, wired Mrs. Sealock asking for a copy
            of the statement but, of course, it could not be given. Omaha
         </del> along with other friends of Dr. Sealock, I have thought that you might be willing to 
         <del class="read the statement [give?]">read the statement give</del> run the statement 
         <del class="[to?]">to</del> in the Congressional Record.

      <p>From what I know of the case I should say that 
         <del class="the public needs to know">the public needs to know</del> a public airing of it would be a good thing. There is every indication that the Board
         wishes to

         be allowed to remain on the memory of such a man as Dr Sealock.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I hope I do not seem officious in venturing to write you about this matter. 
         <del class="[Had it and please?][?]">Had it and please</del>Were I in the habit of thinking of you as merely 
         <del class="a Senator">a Senator</del> another Senator this letter would not have been written, for I

         <del class="I [?]">I </del> and don't want any. I am 
         <del class=""></del> just a human being writing to one whose high humanness has become proverbial; and
         I am one of many who feel deeply that the public should know Dr. Sealock's side of
         this 
         <del class=""></del> tragic affair
