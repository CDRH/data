      <p>I'm back again, for how long I do not yet know. Send on the Masefield book. It hasn't
         come to me from the Journal yet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm ashamed to say that I've found the Pack manuscripts. It was singly hidden away
         in a box of letters. Some of my wife's doings, bless her! I'm sending 
         <del class=""></del> it on.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If the 
         <u>Address</u> is ever revised by the bookfellows; be sure to let me make some slight changes &amp;
         an important addition. You ought to sell 500 easily enough. I'll send a short list
         of names. It's a pity the thing wasn't advertised by the Merchant Club.
