      <p>Yes, another birthday — 50 of them so far! As for "whopping sunsets", the stuff of
         
         <em>ours</em> is already in existence, and nothing but a bit of 
         <em>obvious</em> lying is needed to prove it. Not that I give a damn, but it's so. I have more power
         — or rather have access to greater sources of power — than ever before; and care less
         to use it than ever. But, being here, one might as well let loose. I suppose; though
         I'm a bit fed up on kindergarten stuff &amp; should be glad to try the first grade somewhere
         or other. If 
         <em>this</em> were all, then, obscene Rabelaisian laughter 
         <del class=""></del> would be the most pertinent comment; and when I say this I mean something very definite
         that I could work out convincingly a few hours of conversation. But, this 
         <em>isn't</em> all. That's the only reason I'm at all willing to stay &amp; fool around Our whole social
         structure is too funny for the most abandoned ribaldry to express; but there are fine
         spirits imprisoned here. We will live on for them, humbly, hoping to help.
