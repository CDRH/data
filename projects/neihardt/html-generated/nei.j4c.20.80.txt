      <p>We haven't communicated often of late, but you are in my thoughts very often, and
         you are dear to me â€” one of the very dearest of friends. I just want to say hello,
         and bless your heart! 
         <u>Bless both of you equally in that house of yours where I was happy!</u> Mona and I share the feeling here expressed.
