      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:- </div>
      
      
      <p>I am a sadly disappointed man. For weeks and weeks I have been looking forward to
         the discovery of a shocking number of large and juicy errors in the ADDRESS, and I
         am unable to locate any though I have fine-combed the thing with great meticulosity.
         This seems hardly kind.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There is, I am glad to say, one error in the record of the notification ceremony -
         Mr. Reed for Mr. Brown. You will note the correction in the copy forwarded you today.
         Even this error fails to give me the expected thrill, for I am almost certain that
         the mistake was made in manuscript.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You astonish me when you ask for the rejected "Pack" poem. Good gracious, Man! Those
         were surely sent to you months and months ago. I have not forgotten your shameless
         hectoring, and I'm almost willing to swear that I sent the package to you. Look around
         and I'll do the same here; but I think you'll find them there.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>What a bull little book the ADDRESS is! I refer to the makeup, not to the lecture.</p>
      
      
      <p>Did you note what I said about Rev. Chapman of Butte? When you find time, I wish you'd
         ask to look at his verse.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Is there much dissatisfaction over the "Pack"?</p>
