      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I can hardly believe that I have not written many letters to you, for in the confusion
         of the past weeks - new surroundings and duties and moving the family - I have so
         often talked to you in imagination? I wish it could have been in fact. Things are
         beginning to move here, I think; and my page a sort of clearing house for Western
         opinion - I'll be on the road going somewhere. Famous authors, and have valuable articles
         the P-D gets for nothing. I'll send you my next page - the 4th here.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>We have a nice home at 460 N. Harrison Ave, Kirkwood, Mo - 25 minutes by the steam
         cars from the P-D. You will visit us during the holidays. Hooray! Hurrah! And we'll
         get in the Buick and go out into the woods somewhere &amp; have a talk-fest all alone.
         When are you coming?
      </p>

         <u>Indian Tales</u> have had some powerful reviews. The N.Y. Times &amp; N.Y. Eve. Post especially powerful
         ones. 
         <u>Collected Poems</u> should be out any time now. Three weeks ago I signed 500 sheets for the autograph
         edition.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, I hope you can get at The 
         <u>Man and Poet</u> soon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I love you, dearest Comrade - and always shall.</p>
