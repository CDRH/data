SAVOY, VIA SPEARFISH<br/>
SOUTH DAKOTA</h6>


<span class="dateline">July 7 '07</span>

<span class="salute">Dear Davis: —</span>



	<p>This is to say hello
to you after a long silence
and to ask you to come
to the above address
for your vacation. I wish
you would. If your wife
goes with you, she is
specially invited by my
mother and sister who
are here with me.
We are in Spearfish Canyon
and our cabin is at the
junction of two fine trout
streams. The air is
wonderful, and you can't
beat the scenery except
in the Grand Canyon.
We have a small, rude cabin,
but it keeps the rain out
and we have clean beds
and good grub.</p>

	<p>If you <u>don't</u> know this
country, you <u>ought</u> to
know it!</p>

<p><u>Can't</u> you come? I'd 
like a chance for being
good to you, and my 
mother and sisters would
help me. We are in
touch with Deadwood, and
we could have what we
want.</p>
	<p>Lots of deer here, but
this isn't the season of course.</p>
	<p>We will be here until
Sept. 1st, and the invitation
is open.</p>
	<p>Getting some good material
for yarns. Panned some
placer gold today, just
for fun.</p>
<span class="closer">
	<span class="salute">Yours always,</span>
	<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
