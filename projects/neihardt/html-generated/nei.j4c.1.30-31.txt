      <p>This is to say hello
         to you after a long silence
         and to ask you to come
         to the above address
         for your vacation. I wish
         you would. If your wife
         goes with you, she is
         specially invited by my
         mother and sister who
         are here with me.
         We are in Spearfish Canyon
         and our cabin is at the
         junction of two fine trout
         streams. The air is
         wonderful, and you can't
         beat the scenery except
         in the Grand Canyon.
         We have a small, rude cabin,
         but it keeps the rain out
         and we have clean beds
         and good grub.
      </p>

      <p>If you 
         <u>don't</u> know this
         country, you 
         <u>ought</u> to
         know it!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
         <u>Can't</u> you come? I'd 
         like a chance for being
         good to you, and my 
         mother and sisters would
         help me. We are in
         touch with Deadwood, and
         we could have what we
         want.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Lots of deer here, but
         this isn't the season of course.
      </p>
      	
      <p>We will be here until
         Sept. 1st, and the invitation
         is open.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Getting some good material
         for yarns. Panned some
         placer gold today, just
         for fun.
