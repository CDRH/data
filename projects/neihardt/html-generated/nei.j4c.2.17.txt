<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Cawein:—</span>

<p>I am very grateful to you for your very generous response to my letter. Three of the books have already arrived, and I have spent some profitable hours reading in the "New Poems" volume. How I shall enjoy writing about your work! Have just finished my article on Sterling — whose muse is austere, almost unhuman. You are at the opposite pole in many ways; which only shows how vast is the domain of poetry. What an age we are in! What is wrong with those fussy people who talk so wisely about there being no great poets now? Nonsense! It's a great lyrical age! Isn't it? You were good to mention your liking for some of my stuff. Have you my latest volume, "The Stranger at the Gate"? If not, perhaps you might care to have one from me. I am in the same boat with you as to the necessity of hanging on to the shekels, and I have no copies on hand. But hope is perennial, and I expect to see a bit of cash sooner or later, and I base my offer on this hope. Also, I shall have some more of your volumes.</p>
