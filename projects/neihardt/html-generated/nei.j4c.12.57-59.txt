      <p>I've taken up the matter of pushing the school editions with both Brown and Seaver,
         the latter being the head of the Educational Dept. I urged your value again, and I
         am hoping. Surely the Cycle is digging in steadily, and I'm constantly getting direct
         and indrect evidence of this. My reputation is evidently pretty solid, though I have
         never been touted for a big winner by the hucksters. It is doubtless much better to
         win in that way, for then there can no slump.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Say, Doctor, wouldn't it be a good idea, since we must wait with the Notes for the
         proofs of the new edition, if you would go over the WARS again, at your leisure, and
         note any passages that seem in need of notes and that your may have passed over last
         summer? Historical and geographical points might be emphasized here and there, and
         I'll furnish the stuff, when 
         
      </p>

         you can't, if you will indicate the need by page and line. The school edition of the
         WARS is an important step, and no shots should be missed. I don't know that this is
         necessary in many places, and I'd do it myself, but I feel that you as a teacher know
         better what is needed in the class room. Things would seem obvious to me, sopped as
         I am in the stuff, that would seem anything but obvious to students; and the very
         fact that you yourself are not sopped in the stuff, makes you better able to spot
         the passages that call for comment. You could send me this stuff and I would introduce
         it into your notes at the proper places.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are going to be bigger and bigger doings - you'll see.</p>
      
      
      <p>I seem to be getting stronger on the platform. At any rate, my appearances this past
         year have been most enthusiastically received. I'm running over to Independence for
         a lecture Saturday. My spiel will be radioed, I hear. I take all the engagements I
         can handle, but must turn down some of the best offers.
