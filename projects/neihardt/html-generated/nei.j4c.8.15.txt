      <p>Idaho is seriously considering state adoption of 
         <u>Hugh Glass.</u> 
         <em>You</em> can help tremendously, and I believe you will. Do you care to write a letter to Miss
         Redfield State Supt. of Public Instruction, Boise, Idaho, stating that you have heard
         of the possibilities in Idaho + telling of the results you have obtained with 
         <u>Glass</u>? Also, could you not get others to do likewise - Mrs. Brown of Indianola, for instance?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If I can ever be of service to you, be sure that I shall regard the opportunity as
         a source of genuine pleasure.
      </p>
