      <p>Another dear letter from you — and I do love them! Everything goes on here in keeping
         with an overall pattern, I believe. My classes are a source of much satisfaction to
         
         <del class=""></del> me, and, I hope, to some of my students. I have at least 
         <u>two</u> really good writers in my Critical Essay class, and even the least gifted in writing
         show a creative interest in ideas chosen in the hope of expanding the everyday awareness
         of things. My Epic America students 
         <u>do</u> seem interested. I always wonder about this.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Our colts are growing joyously. My God! how they 
         <u>do love</u> to 
         <u>live</u>! Galloping, kicking, pooping, snorting - with tails like banners waving in a wind
         of glory!
      </p>

      <p>Mrs. Aly (now at the University of Oregon) is pushing ahead with her research, completing
         her dissertation (doctorate) on my work from the viewpoint of speech, 
         <u>and</u> preparing for the biography she will write later. I'm fortunate to have found her
         for she is devoted, thorough, and gifted. I have the task of writing to her about
         many things bearing on my life and my writing, as questions come to her in her research.

      <p>The family is well. Yo-yo (the DOG) is growing wiser and sweeter, and I wonder how a little skin can enclose so much
         love. (Of course it 
         <u>doesn't enclose</u> at all.)

      <p>I think so often of you and your Lady. You are dear, dear.</p>
