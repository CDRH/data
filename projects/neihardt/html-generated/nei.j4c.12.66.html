      Dr. J. T. House,
      
      New River State School,
      
      Montgomery, West Va.
      
      
      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. House: </div>
      
      
      <p>I am very much interested indeed in the magazine which you are going to publish, "Current
         American Literature." There is a need for a publication of this sort, and I think
         you are well qualified to undertake its editorship.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am glad to send you at once a complete set of Edwin Arlington Robinson in the new
         five volume edition which we are just publishing; also the Neihardt short stories,
         and THE RIVER AND I; also Lindsay's COLLECTED POEMS, and such of his prose work as
         we publish.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You speak of Charles and Mary Beard. I think probably you would like THE RISE OF AMERICAN
         CIVILIZATION. I am sending that to you as well. Will you not keep me in touch with
         the progress of your work, and let me see the first issue of the magazine?
      </p>

         <p>This is 
            <em>fine.</em> I can get other publishers for you. What books do you want? Just a dozen + I'll go
            after them.
