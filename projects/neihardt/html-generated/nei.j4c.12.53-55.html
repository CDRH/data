      <p>I've just been asked to write the articles on the Missouri River and the Platte for
         the Encyclopedia Britannica, new edition, and I'm tickled pink. Evidently there are
         others who regard the Missouri as my literary property!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The other day, during the noon hour, I spieled before a wealthy woman's club here
         and got 
         <del class=""></del>$100. It was another smash. They wouldn't let me go, and it is being said that the
         affair was "the best" they ever had there. This is extravagant praise, I'll say. They
         have had nearly 
         <del class="everyone">everyone</del>  every celebrity in Europe and America. Bertrand Russel came before me, and Count
         Keyserling follows.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have three lectures ahead - all in the state - for the next month. The Pennsylvania
         State College has offered me a

         week's engagement for next August, summer session, and I'll accept. We can drive down
         - the whole family - and combine vacation with money-making. Next year I'll be free
         to push ahead with the Cycle, and believe me, the interest in that work is growing
         steadily all over. I'm constantly being reminded of this in ways that can not be doubted.
