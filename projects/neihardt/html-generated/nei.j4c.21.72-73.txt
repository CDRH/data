      <p>This is for both of you, but Bower may not be back yet. I enclose a witnessed record
         of an experience. Perhaps you may want to copy it and return the original to me. Also,
         I enclose some letters that should be useful. The one from Kotoff (who left the University
         over 8 years ago) is typical and may be used in you dissertation. Others will be useful
         in some way, I'm sure.

      <p>You know, of course, that my relation to Mona was no matter

      </p>
      <p>
         <u>leaning</u>
      </p>
      <p>. Our relation was (and is) that of an untroubled comradeship with perfect understanding
         and trust. She 
      </p>
      <p> often said, as a result of certain crises, that 'You always rise to an emergency,
         Daddy'. And I did. So did she!! I could bet on her. I'm in no belly-aching mood. It's
         my body, more than myself that is hard hit. I've been trying to make my solar plexus
         &amp; stomach do their old jobs.

      <p>They are beginning to obey a little better.

         All the while, I remember that the whole human race is troubled, and I have no right
         (or desire) to overstress my hurt. I'm writing you intimately because

      <p>
         <u>you</u>
      </p>
      <p> are my link with the worldly future, and any good that has come through me may go
         on, at least awhile, through you.
