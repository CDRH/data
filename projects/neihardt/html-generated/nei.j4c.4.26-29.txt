      <p>The Ashtouth poem is perfectly ripping, and, like all your work, is perfectly Sterlingesque.
         I mean, it would not be necessary for you to sign it. That's a real compliment. I
         should like to deserve a poem like that after my death. There would be one happy ghost!

      <p>It's too bad that Macmillans business office bucked. I was sure that the readers would
         be strong for the drama, but I was afraid of the business office at this particular
         time. You see, I had had some inside information as to the effect of war conditions
         on the Macmillan consciousness, and for awhile a while I feared that the "Friends"
         might be held up. It was the 
         <u>American</u> character of my stuff and the fact that my piece was one of a series that tipped
         the scales in my favor.

      <p>I have the strongest kind of belief in our Lady Lilith, and sincerely hope that Boni
         &amp; Liveright will take her to their collective bosom. In normal times, I feel sure
         that Macmillans would have taken her gladly. I hope that within a year or two you
         will feel free to offer them a fine selection of your lyrics — say 200 pages. What
         a feast of beauty that would be!

      <p>I'm afraid your Wilton friend hasn't understood the Bolsheviki. His opinion savors
         of capitalistic prejudice. He couldn't be writing for the London Times without a fine
         equipment of capitalistic bias. Have you seen Russell's "Red Russia"? I've read nearly
         every book on Russia that has appeared in English

         and there are good reasons for suspecting that Russell is one of two or three who
         tell the truth. You see, Bolshevism is merely the first attempt and Democracy on this
         planet, and it is natural that the capitalistic press should do everything possible
         to discredit such a movement. We are fed up on scandalous lies. Get "Red Russia" &amp;
         read it, if you haven't. Russell, you know, was one of the American Commission to
         Russia.

      <p>There's a move on to put "Hugh Glass" in the schools — an annotated edition for supplementary
         reading. Dr. Alden of Stanford suggested it. It will probably be adopted in Nebraska
         first. After that it would naturally spread into the adjoining states.
