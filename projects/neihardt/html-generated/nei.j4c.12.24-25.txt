      <p>When I reached home last evening, there sat Mary reading proof on THE RIVER AND I!
         It was a real pleasure to see her again, and the family is glad. She is herself, and
         more than her former self, I feel. A dear girl, truly. We will have some swims, steak
         picnics in the country, and some open air theater (Shakespearean comedy).

      <p>Yes, if you were a millionaire, you'd be offering me a salary to work on the cycle.
         And I'd do it. As it is, I am not even the poor poet of tradition, starving for recognition.
         My stuff sells about as well as any of the better order. Also, my books keep coming
         out, and many believe that my stuff will endure. As for money, I who have never wanted
         to make much of it, must now spend all my time in making more of it than I need. Here
         I am with $7,000 this year (not counting the windfall from Los Angeles), and there
         will be $520 more next year. I can save nearly half of what I make. But something
         will die in me sooner than such things should die. As it is, I think only of seeing
         my seven and their two households out of the woods. I never wanted to live for the
         sake of living. It has always been a terrible thing in my way of thinking - at best,
         a silly process. But perhaps it is better to think that I have already done much and
         justified the years I've had. Also, there is a chance that I may be able to work the
         column in a way to make slow progress on the MESSIAH possible this next fall. I will
         edit STRAWS IN THE WIND during my July and August vacation. Judge V., who was here
         over Sunday, read several

      <p>I was given three days off last week to do a poem on Lindbergh. It was played up in
         big type with a big drawing on the Sunday editorial page. The office 
         <del class=""></del>seems strongly impressed, and I guess it is a pretty fair thing there has been some
         favorable comment. But it doesn't matter at all.
