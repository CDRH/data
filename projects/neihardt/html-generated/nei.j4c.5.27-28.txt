<span class="salute">Dear Sterling:</span>

	<p>Hooray!</p>
	<p>I have just heard that "Lilith" will appear very soon, and I am delighted! Congratulations!</p>
	<p>I don't know which of us owes the other a letter; but it doesn't make any particular difference.</p>
	<p>I finished my history of Western exploration yesterday — nearly 11 months of work. Now after the MS is off my hands, I can get at "The Song of the Sioux Wars".</p>
	<p>Some good will come of the present situation in the publishing business. Many upstarts will be killed off. The years 1912 and '13 were fatally favorable to the production of jackasses!

Now watch them fade away! Of course, many a really good book will be <u>held</u> <u>up</u> because of the situation; but good books can stand that, whereas a punk book can't.</p>
	<p>Upon what are you working now?</p>
	<p>Good luck, Old Man!</p>

<span class="salute">Affectionately,</span>

<br/>Jno.
