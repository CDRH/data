                    <span class="salute">Dear Masters:-</span>
                

<p>It is good news that the class wants me for January 9th. It will give me pleasure to read for them. I have no doubt that you and Long will be able to agree. I suppose the disagreement is over the other Omaha engagement.
</p>
<p>I am planning that series of lectures to be given at the University in the spring. "-Not verse now, only prose"! I was drunk so long with the WARS, and I have now been sober since August 23rd. Really a terrible experience! These necessary drab delays between big jobs make me feel again what I meant when I wrote LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS. But once I got well <u>under</u> with the lectures I shall be fairly happy again.
</p>
<p>With every kind thought for yourself and Mrs. Masters,
</p>
