      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling:- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>Your good letter reached me this morning, &amp; I must say a few things to you while I'm
         digesting a lunch (!) of baked beans.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The first thing in line is to insist that you stop &amp; give us a chance at you when
         you pass through as Omaha is in your route, &amp; Bancroft is only $1.46 more &amp; 73 miles.
         You can do it nicely! I am poor, as you know, but always have enough to eat, &amp; we
         can give the front of the house to sleep in, providing you can sleep on a couch &amp;
         if you can't you are not the Scout I take you to be. Eh? What? Of course you can stop
         off!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>So when are you due?</p>

      <h6 class="fw">2</h6>
      
      
      <p>The second thing: My friend, Kreider, a composer, is in Calif. now &amp; will go East
         soon. He admires your stuff &amp; wants to call on you if he may. If this is agreeable,
         won't you drop him a line 
         <u>at once</u>? His address is:
         
         
         Noble W. Kreider,
         762 St. John's Ave.,
         Pasadena
         
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I haven't mentioned the selection of lyrics simply because I have a better plan. That's
         all. I understand you perfectly.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As for Greek &amp; Latin — I go in more for the former, tho' I am only a tyro. Nevertheless,
         I shall continue until I dir. The way is the goal, anyway. I love the stuff. Larin
         is too foursquare 
         <span class="">[somehow?]</span>.

         yet I once ate Latin as a regular diet. Never was an expert, but was pretty fair at
         it. Greek seems an essential to happiness almost. Yes, you dear chap, you did send
         the sonnet! And a riffing thing it is!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Glad you are feeling better.</p>

      <p>Have reached line 900 in Hugh Glass. It moves slowly, but it is 
         <u>constructed</u>, I think. The problem is very different from that of a lyric. You once asked why
         I used rhyme instead of blank verse? Because one may use the 
         <u>
            <span class="">[method?]</span>
         </u>

         of blank verses in rhyme, and the latter acts as a necessary limitation. Rhyme makes
         for 
         <u>economy</u> &amp; speed &amp; gives a sort of "come on" to a tale. I'm using it in "Hugh Glass", but
         with the tricks of blank verse always working. Catch me?
