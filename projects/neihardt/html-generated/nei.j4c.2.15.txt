      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Chapman:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I shall take charge of a literary department in the Minneapolis Journal on September
         first. I am planning a series of articles (to be illustrated with photographs) dealing
         with a very select number of poets and prose writers. The Journal, as you may know,
         has excellent standing and has the largest circulation in the Northwest. I hope to
         do a little good with my series.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I want to do an article on you. I feel some pride in the fact that I was among the
         first to sound the trumpets over your "Learning and Other Essays". This time I should
         like to deal not only with your work, but with 
         <u>you</u>. To do this I need data, biographical and otherwise, a photograph of you and one
         of your home where you do your work, some of the things that the better critics have
         said about your work etc.etc. I assure you that I shall not be fulsome. I would not
         insult you with cheap praise or mushy comment. Perhaps you would instruct your publishers
         to send me one or two more books (review copies).
      </p>
      
      
      <p>By doing this for me you will be putting me under obligations; but I shall endeavor
         to do you good in return.
      </p>
