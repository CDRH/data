      <p>Your dear letter means everything to me. Bless you. All you say is true, and I am
         so glad you wrote about the

      <p> in her face. It was so strikingly characteristic that even strangers have remarked
         about it. It was the spirit shining through. (She had been preparing to go for a long
         while — getting things straightened out — boxes &amp; barrels of papers &amp; trinkets — all
         our rings made

         <u>That</u>
      </p>
      <p> had to be reset, because the ring would go to Sigurd after I was through wearing
         it. She gave me orders about the funeral long before her illness. All this was done
         with no hint of morbidity. We

         as I am needed here.

      <p>The funeral was beautiful — masses of flowers. A minister friend of mine spoke. Then

         <u>I spoke directly to her</u>

         the pianist, played a Bach prelude that she loves.

      <p> The poetry will win over those who come, but how to induce them to come —? A doctor's
         thesis is now being written on my reading of poetry. And, of course,
