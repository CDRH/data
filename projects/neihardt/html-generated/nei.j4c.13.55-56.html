      <p>Your letter reached me early in my vacation here, and things were happening, so that
         I've neglected to answer your questions. I'm ashamed and sorry.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Of course you can do the article on me better than anyone else.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to Indian poetry by Indians, the best I know is in "Indian Love Songs" published
         by Macmillan. The title is misleading + was chosen in the hope of attracting the foolish
         public. There are genuine religious songs in the collection, + some very beautiful.
         All are true + fine. So much that has been published in this line is damned sentimentalism
         concocted by vain white persons hoping to make an impression.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I suppose a complete discussion of Indian poetry 
         <del class=""></del> would have to include Mary Austin's work, and a fairly fashionable article moved
         include Witter Bynner, who is all right at a ladies' tea. Mary Austin knows, however.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>No 
         <u>Indian writer</u> is doing anything worthwhile at all. Indian poetry grew out of the old tribal life.
         I was not, apparently, the product of individual poets in the way ours is.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Sarett is worth while surely. Alexander's "God's Drum" contains genuine Indian stuff,
         but does not move me deeply as do the mystical religious poems of "Indian love songs".
         
         
      </p>

      <p>
         Don't forget Mary Austin. Real stuff there, tho' not of great interest to me, since
         I am as I am. I am not interested in 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Indians</u>
      </p>
      <p> as </p>
      <p>
         <u>Indians</u>
      </p>
      <p> - only as people in a peculiar situation. Human nature in the grip of fate - not
         Indian nature as a curiosity - interests me. And their poetry interests me only because
         it is human + poetry. I'm perhaps the only 
      </p>
      <p> writer this feels in this way. Had they been Chinese or Japs or </p>
      <p> Zulus in a similar situation, my interest would have been the same.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, your feeling about Sarett + Alexander is not wholly unjustified I suspect, though
         God knows 
         <del class=""></del> I can not be envious + would stand for either against their enemies.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
         <del class="Alexander is less the systematizing">Alexander is less the systematizing</del>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In his work on other subjects, Alexander is perhaps less the systematizing philosopher
         than the philosophical mystic. There often + often he scores, with illuminating flashes.
         He has genius I feel sure. Surely his learning is enormous, and as an ethnologist
         
         <del class=""></del> he has 
         <del class=""></del> made 
         <del class=""></del> large and important. Contributions to the study of the Indian.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm going back to St. Louis Saturday.</p>
