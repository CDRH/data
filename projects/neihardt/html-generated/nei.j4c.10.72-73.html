      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade:- </div>
      
      
      <p>Your Thanksgiving letter just arrived, and I'm delighted with waht you have to tell.
         The column ad in the New Republic almost certainly means that Macmillans know what
         Lovett is going to do for the WARS. That is a good sign. We may look for something
         extended, I feel sure. It is not that the publisher is buying an 
         <del class=""></del>a favorable article; but, the article being in sight and very much desired, the ad
         follows. If Lovett turns loose on all my work, it will make a tremendous difference.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The WARS has been treated as a leading book, and the larger reviews are holding back
         until the rush season is over. This is shown by the fact that none of the larger reviews
         has put the book off with a paragraph. There have been some fine things already.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>And listen to this. I asked Latham to tell me something as to how the book is going.
         He reported 1400 copies of the trade edition sold two weeks ago and nearly all of
         the deluxe edition. He added that the outlo
         <del class="k">k</del>ok is "very promising indeed". That gives me $662.50 royalties.
         <del class=""></del> The trade edition, as you know, was published during the second week in 
         <del class=""></del> September. The big sale time is only about to begin, and the book won't die in a season.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have 100 lines of the MESSIAH. Read this to Judge the other day, and he glowed like
         a candle in a fog. I will send the whole first part to you as soon as it is ready. That will be several weeeks from
         
         <del class=""></del> now, however.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, golly how I wish you could be on the road for Macmillans. Maybe this will be
         possible if the WARS

         and the COLLECTED POEMS score heavily, as they may. Certainly, when I see the

         <del class="strategic">strategic</del>
      </p>
      <p> right situation, I'll open up on Macmillans about this. You'd make a killing everywhere.
         And you'd be happy too, I know. And I'd be happier.

      <p>POETIC VALUES was 
         <del class=""></del> to have been issued Nov. 24th, but copies have not yet reached me.

      <p>I'd like to see that number of the REPUBLIC containing the column ad.</p>
