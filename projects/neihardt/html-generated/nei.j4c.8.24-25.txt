<span class="salute">Dear Mr. + Mrs. Masters:-</span>

                <p>I've caught up with my journal work and am beginning again on "The Song of the Indian Wars" after a month's interruption it always takes several days to get back into the mood of the thing; and just now I am at one of those transition points where the going is more than ordinarily efficient easy transitions are nearly half the battle. <u>Flow</u> is the important thing. I'm getting the feel of it in fine shape, however, and expect to be moving on nicely by tomorrow morning.

                    I had a perfectly bully time up there, and a very profitable one for the work. What wonderful friends I have! - and you are of the best. If such friendships were merely personal, I would feel like an impostor; but I know that you and the others are more keen to help the work along than to show your friendship for John Neihardt, who, without the work, would deserve little. That is the way it should be. We are doing something together; and nothing worth doing is likely to be done alone!</p>

<p>It was a lucky day Mr. Master, when you threw your hat into the ring - lucky for the work and for me as the worker.</p>

<p>I was delighted to find Mrs. Masters' verses at the head of an article on the Calhoun affair. I think she has been unnecessarily modest, having never said a word to me about her own efforts that is an exceptionally clever but of occasional verse, and anyone who can do that can do a great deal more. It would interest me greatly to know how much she has written and what she is going

    to do with it. During a year I receive a good many manuscripts from Parnassus climbers, and almost always the case is hopeless. Those who can do things seem to know the truth and do not strenuously seek confirmation of their hopes except by more work. The others clamor piteously for encouragement.</p>

<p>It is beastly hot here; but I know where there is a pool of coolness, and I'm there every afternoon at four with three youngsters and sometimes a grandma. The mama can't go in; which is a pity.</p>
