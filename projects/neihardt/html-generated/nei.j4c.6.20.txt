      <p>I have a letter from our friend, Mr. Ledoux, in which he refers to some suggestion
         of yours regarding the possibility of making moving pictures out of the "Friends"
         and "Hugh Glass".
      </p>
      	
      <p>I am writing this note to assure you that any suggestion coming from you would find
         me hospitable.
