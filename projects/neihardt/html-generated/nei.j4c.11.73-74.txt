      <p>Would you care to write to the Sunday Editor of the Post-Dispatch, offering to 
         <del class=""></del>write a feature article on my COLLECTED POEMS? I rather think you might get across,
         and you'd be paid. It would be an opportunity to sum up my work and its significance.
         You would state that you are the editor of the school editions of my epics and the
         author of a book on me and my work. Frank Mott says he has been commisioned by the
         N. Y. Herald-Tribune to do an article on my Collected Poems.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm looking forward most eagerly to your coming.</p>

      <p>Don't say anything, about my having suggested this, but, of course, you wouldn't point
         out that 
         <span class="">[my?]</span> cycle is of special significance to St. Louis &amp; territory &amp; show why briefly.
