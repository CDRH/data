<span class="salute">Dear Louis:</span>

<p>Your note about the Master's birthday has caught me on the road! I wish I might be present at the dinner in his honor to enjoy the good and true things that will be said of him. And too much can not be said by those who have felt his influence. My own debt to him is very great, for his still white light reached me in the Nebraska cornfields years ago and glorified my world. There must be very many men, now in middle age, who will carry something of his light through and, let us hope, beyond the confusing fogs of the moment. Their victories will be his.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Affectionately,</span>

<br/>Jno.
