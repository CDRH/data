      <p>Your note about the Master's birthday has caught me on the road! I wish I might be
         present at the dinner in his honor to enjoy the good and true things that will be
         said of him. And too much can not be said by those who have felt his influence. My
         own debt to him is very great, for his still white light reached me in the Nebraska
         cornfields years ago and glorified my world. There must be very many men, now in middle
         age, who will carry something of his light through and, let us hope, beyond the confusing
         fogs of the moment. Their victories will be his.
      </p>
