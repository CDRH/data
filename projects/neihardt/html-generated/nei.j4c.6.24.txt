<span class="dateline">Bancroft, Nebraska, Oct. 11, '20.</span>
<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Mott: —</span>


	<p>I have lately been receiving a number of requests for readings in several of the Middle Western states, and a group in South Dakota is planning <del/> a tour of that state for me. I am wondering if it wouldn't be well to find out whether or not your Iowa Press and Authors Club will want me, and, if they want me, when. I do not mean to push the matter, but I would not like to miss a chance to get acquainted with your crowd.</p>
	<p>William B. Feakins Inc. of New York has recently made me a proposition for the eastern tour; but I don't want to go so far this winter. "The Song of the Indian Wars" must not be neglected.</p>

<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">With all kind thoughts,</span>

<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
</span>



<p>My "Splendid Wayfaring" will appear very soon, and I have just given Macmillans a new volume of verse for the spring of '21 — two dramas.</p>
