      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Mott: — </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>I have lately been receiving a number of requests for readings in several of the Middle
         Western states, and a group in South Dakota is planning 
         <del class=""></del> a tour of that state for me. I am wondering if it wouldn't be well to find out whether
         or not your Iowa Press and Authors Club will want me, and, if they want me, when.
         I do not mean to push the matter, but I would not like to miss a chance to get acquainted
         with your crowd.
      </p>
      	
      <p>William B. Feakins Inc. of New York has recently made me a proposition for the eastern
         tour; but I don't want to go so far this winter. "The Song of the Indian Wars" must
         not be neglected.

      <p>My "Splendid Wayfaring" will appear very soon, and I have just given Macmillans a
         new volume of verse for the spring of '21 — two dramas.
