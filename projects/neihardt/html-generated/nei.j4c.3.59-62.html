      <p>So at last it has come to pass that my Scipionic cry — Hodie, hodie, Lillith scribenda
         est! — has had some effect?
      </p>
      	
      <p>Hooray! It's the very best kind of news. If you had told me that your rich Uncle had
         just given you a check for a hundred thousand, I would have been but little moved.
         But I know now that you are most probably writing your masterpiece, and that it is
         a matter for rejoicing. You proved long ago that you are a master of lyric

         poetry, and now you will show them another side of you. It makes me happy, Old Man!
         It's just the proper theme for you.

      <p>I wish I had known that Stoddard's collection 
         <del class=""></del> was not at all representative. I sent in a short review of it last week. The editor needs
         lambasting, evidently, and I've missed my chance. However the book gave me the feeling
         that Stoddard was a rare loveable man.
      </p>
      	
      <p>The fate to which you condemn the spinsters of Chicago is simply awful! Never to be
         
         <del class=""></del>! It is a matter for the S. P. C. A.!

      <p>I'm still moving on with "The Song of Three Friends"; have over 1500 lines. Expect
         to reach the end in February, after two years of work. I sort of think you'll like
         the fellows in my yarn. Hope so, anyway.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I don't know about getting to the Coast. Red Cross work seems to interfere to some
         extent. But perhaps I'll get out there, &amp; if I do, I want to bat around with you a
         little.
      </p>
      	
      <p>As to the degree — doctor me no more doctors when you address me. If John Neihardt
         can't be made to signify anything, then Doc won't help much. Not that  I don't appreciate
         your courtesy. But once is enough to show you're right. It was nice of the University
         to give it to me, &amp; when clubs call me

         "Doctor" I stand for it without a murmur.

      <p>Good luck to you always, Old Man, and once more, hooray for Lillith!</p>
