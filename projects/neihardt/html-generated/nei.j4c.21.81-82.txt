      <p>It was a pleasant flight all the way, and I was cheated out of my $52,500 insurance
         — a fact which irks me a bit! But I almost beat the insurance company. We arrived
         at Columbia Air Port on time; but when we touched the field, it seemed to the pilot
         that the landing gear was hay-wire. The alarm light started going and the thing said
         'beep-beep-beep'. So we circled Columbia for a half hour, hoping to shake the landing
         gear into shape — then

         we headed back to St. Louis for a belly-landing, where we'd have proper fire protection.
         In St. Louis we had a
