      <p>Last night I 
         <u>did</u> read your notes on 
         <u>Three Friends</u>, and you rather astonish me. How you do 
         <u>know</u>, and how unerringly you hit the vital center of things with every shot! You may even
         understand why the reading gave me the feeling of tears deep down inside of me. Surely
         there should be some way of seeing all your notes properly associated with the 
         <u>Cycle</u> before I leave this kindergarten of a world!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Macmillans Co. is so large and unwieldy, with so many officials skilled in passing
         the buck! But who knows what is not possible? In addition to notes, you two are the
         only ones I know, with certainty, who 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>could</u>
      </p>
      <p> do a revealing and honest study of the work &amp; </p>
      <p>
         <u>the life</u>
      </p>
      <p> it represents. Personally,

         I am not ambitious. I prayed regularly for years and years for the ability to complete
         the Cycle, and there was no time when I would not have been willing to be rubbed out
         with the reading of the last line of proof on the last 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Song</u>
      </p>
      <p>, if such an agreement would have insured my ability to finish the work. I don't want
         a life study for 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>me</u>
      </p>
      <p>, but only by way of setting the Cycle in its appropriate atmosphere for understanding.</p>

      <p>The letter you're preparing may be the right one to accompany the Continental Concerts
         material, if you favor the plan I outlined yesterday. You may have better ideas. If
         so, please state them, &amp; we'll be grateful.

      <p>There should be no difficulty in obtaining permission, if necessary, to use your notes
         up there. How
