      <p>It was good to hear from you again and to know that you liked the Alys. They 
         <u>are</u> very fine people — and very able too. Mrs. Aly wrote glowingly about you, John. She
         mentioned "the twinkle in your face" when you talked to her. I remember that "twinkle",
         John; and I'm glad it is still there! Mrs. Aly also wrote 
         <u>most appreciatively</u> of Edna and her husband. I'm so glad you all liked each other.

      <p>Yes, I remember the diving into muddy Logan Creek — and I remember a heck of a lot
         more too!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I appreciate your wish to pay for the 
         <u>Cycle</u>, but it's a gift for old time's sake, John. You are a piece of my life, you know!
         I'm returning the  bill.
