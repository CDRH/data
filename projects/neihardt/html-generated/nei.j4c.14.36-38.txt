      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I have purposely refrained from expressing to you very much of what I know to be true
         about the world situation. I did not want to seem 
         <u>too</u> despairing. With me it has too often been terrible, but I've decided at last - or
         so I think - that I must guard against tearing myself to pieces, since nothing can
         be done to help. 
         <u>We are now living in a vast kindergarten without a teacher!</u>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I do not look forward to any special or inevitable "great day beyond" the growing
         darkness - not in this world. But it is not inconceivable that what is preparing all
         over the world may greatly decrease the earth's population, and that alone would be
         a favorable circumstance. Also, the profit system will have been wiped out - perhaps
         another favorable circumstance. Anyway, if one, being human, must hope, it is necessary
         to look  beyond what is inevitable - how far beyond God knows &amp; he probably non-existent!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>But there are thousands of us home-sick ones still on the planet, and we'll have to
         encourage each other to live &amp; cherish the values that have cost so many generations
         so tremendous a price. Anyway, this world may well be, as I am persuaded to suspect, only a fragment of 
         <em>the real world</em>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am able to testify daily in my columns, and I wonder why the P-D lets me go; for
         I say things with death in them for the whole present world-scheme. Is it possible
         that the P-D doesn't get my meaning? I can't believe it, for Clark McAdams is an intelligent
         radical. But, my god, why

         haven't they canned me before now? Quite often I hear from readers who seem glad for
         what I say, and, curiously enough, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>nobody</em>
      </p>
      <p> ever calls me down. (I sometimes wish this might happen.) And yet St. Louis, being
         full of colleges and universities, must contain many who at least rate themselves
         as intellectuals.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I can't get the Messiah to you in time for your trip East. Have neglected to have
         it copied. Will do so at once &amp; be ready for you upon your return. I'll write Benet
         that you want to know him. Where shall I say he can reach you with a note? Answer
         quickly.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Comrade, quite clearly you are dealing with a fool when you deal with Pattee. I'm
         almost sorry I drew your attention to the fellow. It was damned selfish of me. But
         it would be in your proper line to call him down for his 
         <u>general</u> incompetence, making my case only a part of the indictment. I think you 
         <u>should</u> do this, as a man having more lights than most. But try to make it all 
         <u>quit hurting you</u>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Endless love, best of Comrades! I'm so glad you see too, for were you in anyway conventionally
         blinded, there would be so much 
         <u>less</u> of you to love!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Anyway, your magazine is worth while. Turn loose, saying what, after careful thought,
         you believe. It's not time for sitting on fences. "Liberalism" is for pink teas now
         â€” more's the pity. I wish weren't but it is.
