      <p>I am anxiously awaiting the
         arrival of the 
         <u>profile</u> taken in the 
         
         <u>blue coat</u>. The picture taken
         in the black one is rather vague.
         All that I gather from it is that
         you are taller or shorter than
         the other gentleman who is not
         you. I am very thankful for this,
         however.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I wonder if Mr. Waters has 
         given you a headache.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I'm glad you have lots of fun,
         even tho' I have less. Your
         unfailing optimism must be a 
         great comfort to you. As for me,
         altho' I fight against them, the 
         blue devils do come at times
         	Don't forget the profile—Please.
      </p>
