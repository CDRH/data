<span class="salute">My dear Davis:—</span>

	<p>I am anxiously awaiting the
arrival of the <u>profile</u> taken in the 
<u>blue coat</u>. The picture taken
in the black one is rather vague.
All that I gather from it is that
you are taller or shorter than
the other gentleman who is not
you. I am very thankful for this,
however.</p>
	<p>I wonder if Mr. Waters has 
given you a headache.</p>
	<p>I'm glad you have lots of fun,
even tho' I have less. Your
unfailing optimism must be a 
great comfort to you. As for me,
altho' I fight against them, the 
blue devils do come at times
	Don't forget the profile—Please.</p>
<span class="closer">
	<span class="salute">Yours sincerely,</span>
	<br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
