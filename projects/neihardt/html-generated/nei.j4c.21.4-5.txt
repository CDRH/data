      <p>I've been thinking about your proposed work on public speaking in America since the
         Revolution, and the thought is thrilling. It's a whale of a book — already 
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
         <em>living</em>
      </p>
      <p> social history of our developing country, running the gamut of human experience from
         low comedy to high tragedy. Considering only the stuff of my own time, I can feel
         the greatness of the theme. And what

         fun you'll have doing it — along with the hard work!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It was good to see you, but I do regret that Mona could not be with us. There'll be
         another time.
