                <p>So I am even further indebted to you, if that be possible!</p> 
                
                <p>Of course I'd like to return to Cornell — and see you and Thompson. I am glad you want me to give a program of Lyrics, and I hope it may be possible to round up a fairly good audience — good in quantity, I mean. The quality is assured, but even if it were not so, I'd feel sure of the response. I've had audiences <del/> on all levels, and the response is always

                    the same. Roughnecks or sophisticates — it seems to make no difference. And I love to do the thing. Also, I'll look forward to the classes, which will merely seem like my own classes here. I'd like more than one class, if there should be time for more — <u>and</u> the desire for more.</p>
                
                <p>I'm beginning my 10th year here at M. U., and my Epic America class will be the 20th. About 100 pre-registered for the course, and there should be 25 more, at least,

                    on the regular registration days, Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. It's an elective course, giving graduate credit, and our prerequisites are stiff.</p>
                
                <p>I know how it is at my own university. So much is always going on, and so many more or less important people are constantly appearing. There will be no crashing of the gates to hear me!! I'll be glad for those who <u>do</u> come.</p>
                
                <p>If you need any sources of information about me and my stuff, I'd suggest the following at least:

                <p>May 21st is just right for me. I have classes on the 20th and 22nd, but I have an excellent grader, and he can give a review on the 20th and the final test on the 22nd. My last class day is on the 27th, and I can use that day (2 hrs) for the final reading of the <u>Song of the Messiah</u>.</p>
