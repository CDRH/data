      <p>So I am even further indebted to you, if that be possible!</p> 
      
      
      <p>Of course I'd like to return to Cornell — and see you and Thompson. I am glad you
         want me to give a program of Lyrics, and I hope it may be possible to round up a fairly
         good audience — good in quantity, I mean. The quality is assured, but even if it were
         not so, I'd feel sure of the response. I've had audiences 
      </p>
      <p> on all levels, and the response is always

         the same. Roughnecks or sophisticates — it seems to make no difference. And I love
         to do the thing. Also, I'll look forward to the classes, which will merely seem like
         my own classes here. I'd like more than one class, if there should be time for more
         — 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>and</u>
      </p>
      <p> the desire for more.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'm beginning my 10th year here at M. U., and my Epic America class will be the 20th.
         About 100 pre-registered for the course, and there should be 25 more, at least,
         
         
      </p>

      <p>
         
         on the regular registration days, Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. It's an elective course, giving
         graduate credit, and our prerequisites are stiff.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I know how it is at my own university. So much is always going on, and so many more
         or less important people are constantly appearing. There will be no crashing of the
         gates to hear me!! I'll be glad for those who 
         <u>do</u> come.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you need any sources of information about me and my stuff, I'd suggest the following

      <p>May 21st is just right for me. I have classes on the 20th and 22nd, but I have an
         excellent grader, and he can give a review on the 20th and the final test on the 22nd.
         My last class day is on the 27th, and I can use that day (2 hrs) for the final reading
         of the 
         <u>Song of the Messiah</u>.
