      <p>The enclosed should have been mailed some days ago. Thought it had gone.</p>
      
      
      <p>John Macy writes long fine letter, saying I was only one who got his point in his
         World Literature, and praising my "long-standing achievement"; begging also that I
         
         <del class=""></del>"add to my fragrant laurels his poor devoted thanks". He is putting me in his new
         school book. Also Payne of Tex. U. is putting me in his new school book. Also 
         <u>The Texas Outlook</u>, which goes to 22000 teachers, is boosting my stuff for schools - very devotedly.

      <p>It moves.</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, Amy got the Prize, no surprise to me, and no disappointment. She is dead in
         two ways.
