      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade:- </div>
      
      
      <p>I was very glad to hear from you.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the matter of book reviewing, I don't feel as you do, and I want to send you
         some more books when the season opens. Perhaps you should do the sort of book that
         will draw upon your learning and your knowledge of social questions. As I told you,
         we can't attack the capitalist system, but light can be thrown on the situation without
         doing that. I am delighted to hear about Fagin's project.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am on four weeks' vacation and I think I shall stay here the whole time. Mona is
         learning to walk now, and can get as far as our garden. She is still very thin, but
         is gaining rapidly and the sickness is definitely gone.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Do you plan to stay in College Park next winter?</p>
      
      
      <p>Dear Comrade, this carries the old affection unchanged. The thought of you is dear
         to me although I am not much of a correspondent. I wish we could be together awhile
         again.
      </p>
