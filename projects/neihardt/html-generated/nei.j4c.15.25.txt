      <p>As to compensation for lectures, I seldom receive less than one hundred dollars, but
         in this case I should like to leave the matter entirely to you and to the various
         schools. They will know what they can pay and since I intend to be in Nebraska anyway,
         going nearly as far west as Chadron, traveling expenses may be overlooked.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I don't know where the time has gone since your letter arrived -- a whole week!</p>
