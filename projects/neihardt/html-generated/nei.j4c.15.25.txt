                <p>As to compensation for lectures, I seldom receive less than one hundred dollars, but in this case I should like to leave the matter entirely to you and to the various schools. They will know what they can pay and since I intend to be in Nebraska anyway, going nearly as far west as Chadron, traveling expenses may be overlooked.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know where the time has gone since your letter arrived -- a whole week!</p>
