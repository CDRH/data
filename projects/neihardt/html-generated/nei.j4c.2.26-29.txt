      <p>How are you and what are you doing? When I last heard from you, the outlook wasn't
         merry; but I'm happy by this time you have got the 
         <span class="">[grip?]</span> again.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>What of the world—Tramp you mentioned as a probability? It would be fine in a way,
         but don't you need a scholar's seclusion &amp; quiet for 
         <u>your</u> real work? Don't you think constant change of scene &amp; The state of mind that wandering
         gives would tend Toward scatteration? No vagabond could have done your splendid sonnets.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Sterling, I think a great deal about you, you seem like a relative who has always
         been far enough

      <p>I often think of your Trouble &amp; feel hurt. It's a shame that you couldn't just go
         on greatly doing what you are so wonderfully fitted to do. I know all about the Gospel
         of Suffering. Much of it is 
         <span class="">[?]</span>; some of it is true. It seems to me, though, that pain is good for discipline only
         in the early 
         <span class="">[?]</span> stage. Later a man needs peace &amp; a steady purpose. I should like to think of you
         growing old in Carmel. People 
         <span class="">[mouth?]</span> about the world as though it were something distant that one must reach by a journeyand
         it is right here at any door among the cornfield. I have found as much superficiality
         among the learned in

         as among the bumptrous members of our rural woman's clubs. I have no desire to knock
         about. Did you ever see anything new or strange? Did you? It's such an old story when
         a fellow gets there.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Do you ever read Greek or Latin? All winter I've slept 3 hours a night on Greek, &amp;
         I look forward to that time as to a vacation. All day I read &amp; discuss modern things
         &amp; at night there's that wonderland waiting.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I spend Fridays, Saturdays &amp; Sundays on my "Song of Hugh Glass", &amp; the thing forges
         ahead in a way that surprises me. Have been getting 50 lines per week on the average.
         
         There is no padding in it. Old man, I believe I'm getting something worth while. Hope
         to finish by May.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Wish I could see you &amp; have a hell of a good pow-wow with you!</p>
