      <p>It is bully to be writing to you in Athens, for I cannot think of a place in this
         world where you would be more at home spiritually than there; but when I say "there",
         I am not thinking of modern Athens at all, but of an Athens that is unknown to geographers.
         We have often been together when you were truly in Athens with the Nebraska winter
         just outside the window. I am not surprised that you remark, "there is really nothing
         in particular to say". Of course there is nothing to say that you could not and have
         not said to me gloriously in our ambrosial nights of long ago. "By going far, we discover
         nothing; by going fast, we overtake nothing". It has all been with you these many
         years that I have been made stronger by your friendship. Nevertheless, I hope that
         when you saw the place where Socrates is said to have been imprisoned in his last
         days, you thought of me, and also when you stood on the spot where long ago the great
         passages of Aeschylus were heard for the first time.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Since you left, I have been called to St. Louis for a conference with Pulitzer and
         Clark McAdams, head of the editorial page. Their idea is that I should return to St.
         Louis, doing two of my critical columns a week and writing regularly for the daily
         editorial page. Happily, the new arrangement will not begin until spring, and I shall
         be able to forge ahead to the end of the MESSIAH. I want to be in a center of population when the big things begin to happen. I am
         afraid they are not ready to happen very soon, but I want to be on the ground when
         they do. Macmillans are announcing THE SONG OF THE MESSIAH in their spring catalog, and they already have material for the dummy, although I
         know that the book cannot appear before next fall, and maybe not before January, 1935.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The State Teachers College of Moorhead, Minnesota, which is a part of Fargo, N. D.,
         as you know, has invited me to lecture there and has offered me far more than I think
         I am worth. I shall be there on January 18.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It is good to know that you will be back in the U. S. before too long, and I do hope
         we can get together again, as we used to do. Will it be in the plains of Nebraska
         or in the mountains of West Virginia? I rather hope that it may be the former.
      </p>
