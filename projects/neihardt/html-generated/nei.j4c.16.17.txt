<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p>One more comment on your Coolidge. You felt, evidently, as I did, that the last column of his letter was perhaps a bit over eloquent; but you can tone such things down if you should use more of his stuff. I just want you to know that I felt about this much as you did. There is a wallop in the man, I know.</p>
