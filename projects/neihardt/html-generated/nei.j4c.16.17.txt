      <p>One more comment on your Coolidge. You felt, evidently, as I did, that the last column
         of his letter was perhaps a bit over eloquent; but you can tone such things down if
         you should use more of his stuff. I just want you to know that I felt about this much
         as you did. There is a wallop in the man, I know.
      </p>
