      <p>That is a dear letter and it does me good. I feel in it the same glow that I used
         to see in your face--and want to see it again.

      <p>I think Simon &amp; Schuster would be better than Macmillans--far fewer publications,
         more cleverness in promotion. I hope they'll want the book.

      <p>Homer's book is a joy. I'm so glad about it.</p>
      
      
      <p>No more now, but this carries the old gratitude and love, dearest comrade,</p>
