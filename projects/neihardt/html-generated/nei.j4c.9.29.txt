      <p>Upon examining True's letter again, I find that he quotes the mot in question, thus
         proving that he was correctly named. As for Wilde, I used to him many years ago when
         I was very old and disenchanted.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I will undertake to realize the divine Truth that there is no such thing in Mind as
         not being present at the annual banquet of the Bookfellows. Perhaps I shall be able
         to demonstrate.

      <div class="note">It would appear from this passage that the eminent and ill-fated Doctor, as certain
         professors allege, may indeed have espoused the doctrine of Mrs. Mary B.G. Eddy shortly
         before the incandescent light of reason was forever extinguished in that dome of erudition.
