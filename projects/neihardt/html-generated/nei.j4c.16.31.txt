<span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>
                
<p>I have heard from the Secretary of the Nebraska Association, and I understand that the program committee is considering me. Many thanks.</p>
                
<p>It seems now that I should be on my way to Pine Ridge early in June. You mentioned having me talk to your students again. Would some time in early June be suitable for you? Upon hearing from you I will write to Peru and to Kearney. I have not been to either place for some years.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">With the old affectionate thoughts,</span>

<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno.
<br/>John G. Neihardt
