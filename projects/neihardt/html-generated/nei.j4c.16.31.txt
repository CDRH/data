      <p>I have heard from the Secretary of the Nebraska Association, and I understand that
         the program committee is considering me. Many thanks.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It seems now that I should be on my way to Pine Ridge early in June. You mentioned
         having me talk to your students again. Would some time in early June be suitable for
         you? Upon hearing from you I will write to Peru and to Kearney. I have not been to
         either place for some years.
      </p>
