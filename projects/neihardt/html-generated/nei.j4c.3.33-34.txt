      <p>Mr. Kreider says the week of June 11th suits him; so if you can set a day in that
         week, I'll go ahead with arrangements for the recital here. Let me know. I'll send
         you material for an announcement in your papers a little later. It will be a treat
         for us.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Your letter was bully, altho' you called it incoherent. I had half a notion to send
         it to Marsh of Macmillans! By the way, Marsh (the vice-president) writes: "Hugh Glass
         is getting some really fine reviews, as you see. I have not yet seen the  big arresting
         review which will give it the place it deserves in American literature, but I still
         hope someone will

      <p>
         
         do this for us." Now who is going to do it?
      </p>
      	
      <p>I wrote to Prof. Wilson as you directed. It's good news that he thinks of having me
         there.
      </p>
      	
      <p>How goes the book? I'm getting eager. I know it will be worthwhile. Am just putting
         the finishing touches on my "Lyrics", the next volume. It will contain all my best.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Do you enjoy doing the "Notes"? I almost love your class for being enthusiastic about
         "The Song"; but nine-tenths of that is in your presentation, I'm sure.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Good luck to you &amp; the book.</p>

      <p>Don't you really want that presidency? If the book goes off well, you 
         <span class="">[?]</span> want it.
