      <div class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly: </div> 
      <p>Yours of the 10th is here, and it is full of very good news! On the 11th I wrote more
         on the socialism-totalitarianism theme, 10 pages 
         <del class=""></del> which I am holding for Enid to copy. Even with this, so much is left to say by way
         of applying the thesis to world affairs etc. But the 
         <del class=""></del> rapidly written sketch does expand the idea a bit &amp; suggest universal application.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Here are answers following the order of your questions of Nov. 12th:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>(1) I'll write a special letter on my adventure with the hysterical group during World
            War I — not too important, but of some significance I believe.
         </li>
         
         
         <li>(2) 
            <p>The story of Trudeau and the rattlesnake was told to me by Howard Morton whose eye
               was shot out in the Beecher Island Fight. I met him &amp; his daughter in California,
               in 1917, I believe. Where, I forget — either S. F. or L. A. But the story 
               <u>is</u> printed somewhere in some historical society collections. Could be Kansas Hist. Soc.
               I hope one of my letters in the collection at M. U. tells of my visit with Morton.

            <p>Fine about the 2 
               <del class=""></del> Sterling letters found at Mills College! How 
               <u>did</u> they get there, I wonder? Mills wanted me to come over &amp; give a lecture, but I was
               compelled to move on to Portland etc.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>(3) John Galen Howard would 
            <u>not</u> throw my letters away. We were very close. He called me "Beloved John". I suspect
            the daughter's search was not thorough.
         </li>
         
         
         <li>(4) The Bob Davis letters! Hurrah! I do hope Davis saved the one in which I assailed
            his shallow criticism of 
            <u>The Alien</u> (which he 
            <u>did</u> buy &amp; publish). It 
            <u>was</u> a good one — headlong and true. You may have seen his reply, which should be in the
            M. U. collection. He said in substance: "Why did you jump on me like that? I'm not
            a literary man, I'm only a journalist." His reply was most humble and characteristically
            amusing.

            <p>It's so good that are actually reading my old Bancroft Blade! I was 22 years old when
               I took it over, and I was having a swell time with it! Where did you find the McKinley
               poem? I wrote it for the Omaha Daily News in 1901 (wasn't it?). I was living in a
               garret room with 
               <del class=""></del> only a sky
               <del class=""></del>light at the time, I recall. I also wrote "Lonesome in Town" in that god-awful place.
               Didn't stay there long, however. I don't recall the "other poems" you mention, but
               will when I see them. Yes, I remember Bixby — a most remarkable character. Ran a daily
               column on the Neb. State Journal. He was the first 
               <del class=""></del> widely known versifying columnist in the country, and 
               <u>very</u> clever. I knew him slightly and admired him greatly. I do 
               <u>not</u> recall the "poem" from the card game. Quote a line or two that I may remember, please.

         <li>(6) 
            <p>The Blade editorials, especially on Russia, showing the early phase of my thought
               about world matters — How come? you ask. The answer is that I was something of the
               "intellectual socialist"!! I mean, I was deep in social 
               <del class=""></del> and economic literature — as well as history; and I was always, as far back as I
               can remember, eager to find the 
               <u>larger patterns</u> back of events. I was doing a lot of reading, thinking, and dreaming. No doubt Prof.
               Jim Pile's remark about Russia and the U. S. was in my thoughts somewhere. In the
               
               <del class=""></del> Russo-Jap War, I was not a partisan. It was a 
               <u>tremendous spectacle</u> for me. I pitied 
               <del class=""></del> the Russians when their fleet was sunk. I 
               <u>admired</u> the 
               <u>Japs</u> for their high morale and fighting qualities.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It's good 
               <del class=""></del> that you will be here at Xmas! Of course we'll have a talk.
