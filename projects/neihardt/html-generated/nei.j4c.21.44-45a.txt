      <div class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly: </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm at the office. Want to tell you about John Chaffee. He was not my companion on
         the trip down the Missouri in 1908. He came 10 years earlier. John had a stroke after
         his wife died last August, and his sister, Edna, writes his letters: Edna has an invalid
         husband, and I'm sure the situation is a bit saddening. John is looking forward to
         seeing you &amp; Dr. Aly.
      </p>

      <p>My boy companion on the trip down in 1908 was Chet Marshal, dead long ago.</p>
      
      
      <p>I hope you can cheer John up. His wife's death seems to have broken him.</p>
