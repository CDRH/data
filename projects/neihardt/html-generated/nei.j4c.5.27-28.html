      <p>Hooray!</p>
      	
      <p>I have just heard that "Lilith" will appear very soon, and I am delighted! Congratulations!</p>
      	
      <p>I don't know which of us owes the other a letter; but it doesn't make any particular
         difference.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I finished my history of Western exploration yesterday — nearly 11 months of work.
         Now after the MS is off my hands, I can get at "The Song of the Sioux Wars".

      <p>Some good will come of the present situation in the publishing business. Many upstarts
         will be killed off. The years 1912 and '13 were fatally favorable to the production

      <p>
         <u>up</u>
      </p>
      <p> because of the situation; but good books can stand that, whereas a punk book can't.</p>
      	
      <p>Upon what are you working now?</p>
      	
      <p>Good luck, Old Man!</p>
