      <p>I have just rec'd a letter from Henry Van Dyke (of all men!) Since he is, of course,
         a great power in educational affairs, I've thought you might see a way to use him
         in the matter of getting "Glass" endorsed by the National Council of English Teachers.
         His letter is as follows:

            <p> by John G. Neihardt. This is a fine poem of the Wild West, a vigorous epic of American
               adventure in the highlands where the Missouri gathers its

               loyal, indomitable, richer in passion than in words. Well has he told  the tale of

      <p>Van Dyke represents Princeton. We already have Moulton for Chicago U. and the Yale
         Review article. These three, used with other material &amp; infleunce that we have, should
         have great power. I hurry this to you in order that you may change. Perhaps you will
         want to write Van Dyke. If so, his address is:
         <br></br>
         
         
         "Avalon",
         Princeton, N. J.

      <p>You might get him for honorary member.</p>
