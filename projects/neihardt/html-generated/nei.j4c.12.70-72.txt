<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>I couldn't get the MS off until today, which is pretty late. But I note by yours just received that you are going ahead and that what you are doing even be substituted for the Notes I am returning to you. Bully!

<p>Cut out any explanations that, upon second thought, seem obvious, that is, obvious to the sort of people we must reach. Enid will copy what you send back.</p>

<p>And be sure to send me a bill for your time. That is the rest thing to do. <div class="note">Make it enough to cover.</div></p>
