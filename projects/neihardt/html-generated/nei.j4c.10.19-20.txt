      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade:- </div>
      
      
      <p>I have the copy of the Herald. The whole thing is perfectly wonderful. I'm eager to
         know about the location and character of the monument. Your feeling about the location
         was right, but there is that strong pull towards the normal. I could not forget that
         easily, because of the Conns and you. As a matter of fact, the Normal, to me, means
         Conn and House.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Friends and Glass in the M.R.S. sold slightly over 3,000 copies last year, which is certainly an encouraging
         advance. That would mean more than one hundred new schools - probably as much as two
         hundred. It's really an excellent gain. Just the same, I feel certain that a far greater
         gain could be made next year if the matter were properly pushed - pushed as many a
         younger company would push. Macmillans are slow and dignified. I suppose that, in
         the long run, there is a solid advantage in dignity and all that. But more could be
         done with dignity and all that. But more could be done with dignity, I'm sure. I do
         wish you could have a pow wow with the head of the Educational Department - face to
         face.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Isn't it rather funny that we do not know what schools are using the book? Shouldn't
         we know? It would make a fine list.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The three new books, appearing within nine months, may well make a great difference
         all around.
