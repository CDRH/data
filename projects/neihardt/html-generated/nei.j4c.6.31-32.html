      <p>You must have wondered why I have not written about your article. On Oct. 29 I left
         Bancroft to buy a home in the Ozarks, and here I am with all my family, including
         my mother. I have bought a very pretty place with lots of house room for my friends
         (which certainly includes you), and a wide view on one of the most beautiful regions
         I have seen. I had to come ahead, and my folks looked after the packing. Your article
         arrived after I left Bancroft. My wife put it in her grip, but a neighbor asked to
         read it during the last night in Bancroft, and it didn't get back into the grip.

         As a result, I have not yet read the article. My folks tell me it is a fine one, which
         doesn't surprise me. I wrote over a week ago to have the copy sent on, but, as I have
         said, it hasn't turned up. Dr. House has a copy in Wayne, and said he would send it
         to me. I suppose I will see it soon. Am very eager to get it.

      <p>I am to make a reading tour through Nebraska and South Dakota in January. Will be
         at the U. of So. Dak in Jan. 10, and there will be five or six other S. D. towns to
         visit immediately after. I wish arrangments could be made for me to turn up in Indianola
         and at Grinnel. I could return that way from South Dakota.

      <p>I received a letter from the Iowa Press and Authors' Club just as I was getting

         on the train at Bancroft, inviting me to be the guest of honor in Des Moines on the
         18th Nov. Of course I couldn't accept. It hurt to refuse.

      <p>Some time you will visit me here, and we will have some happy days and nights together.
         You will be welcome at any time. This is a great place for a vacation. We are one-half
         mile from Lake Taneycomo, and there are so many woodsy roads to follow.
