      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Mosher:— </div>
      
      
      <p>I am in receipt of your kind letter of late date. Would state that I was a little
         surprised to learn that you had considered a Neihardt number no later than two years
         ago. I was given to understand that the matter had been settled last winter. But I
         see there has been a mistake, and it does not matter.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I appreciate your reasons for being disinclined to use American writings. I beg you
         to believe that my letter is not to be interpreted as a movement on my part to induce
         you to use my lyrics, though of course I should be willing and glad if you cared to
         use some of them. The matter was brought to my attention by a friend in New Rochelle
         who is an admirer of your publications and of my work. It came to me as a pleasant
         surprise. Later I understood that Mr. Kennerley had given permission as publisher.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If at any time you should care to use my lyrics, you have my permission. I had not
         thought of any financial remuneration.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am sure that your admiration of Mr. Robinson's work is well placed.</p>
