      <div class="salute">Dear Friend:— </div>
      
      	
      <p>Your visit had the usual good effect. I was doubly a poet yesterday, &amp; finally wrought
         lines fairly besieged me. I am going to have a wonderful time in describing that superb
         body of 
         <span class="">[?]</span>. There is something almost intoxicating about the thought of capturing all those
         lines about it that are after me yet today. You are always an instrument in time when
         I see 
         <u>you</u>, &amp; that augments whatever music is in me.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>After you left, I began really to think about Mrs. Sheldon's letter. I couldn't quite
         see all

         around it while you were here. And it has come to seem to me that I ought 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>not</u>
      </p>
      <p> to accept the $15 offer for an appearance before the Thursday Lecture Circle. The
         Woman's Club might be all right; would be so, if the women could take me seriously
         enough to pay as others have &amp; will pay. You see, Doctor, the fact is that to those
         women I am a sort of local celebrity trying to get on. But I am decidedly not that.
         Perhaps it would be better to give the women time to learn something about modern
         American poetry before I go to them. I dislike 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>patronage</u>
      </p>
      <p> based on a poor understanding, as this is likely to be.</p>

      <p>Don't you think it would be better to save Lincoln for a better opportunity if the
         Woman's Club doesn't want me enough to pay me?
      </p>
      	
      <p>You are my friend — one of my very best friends — and you will not see in this anything
         even remotely resembling a lack of appreciation for your efforts. You must remember
         that my home state, until you came, did absolutely nothing for me. London &amp; New York
         &amp; Chicago &amp; San Francisco 
         <del class=""></del> praised me long before Nebraska knew of my existence. They must 
         <u>want</u> me, or I must not go to them.

      <p>I mentioned Mrs. Borghum of Omaha as the woman who could &amp; would handle a reading
         in Omaha, — Mrs. August Borghum. I have misplaced her address, but the family is well
         known  there. I would like to go to Omaha.
