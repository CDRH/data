      <p>Thanks, thanks, dear Davis, for
         sending me the "map" of the Little
         Buffalo. And you were very
         kind to mention my mother.
         Last night I received a copy of 
         the "Bundle" by mail. Stunning
         getup! You'll like it! This
         first copy, of course, goes to my
         mother. But I will have
         others soon, and then you get
         yours.
      </p>
      
      <p>I've got a mighty warm place in
         my heart for Davis.
      </p>
