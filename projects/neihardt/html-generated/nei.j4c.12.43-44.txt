      <p>Yes. I'm sure you can and will make it "a glorious fight" your letter errs, if at
         all, on the side of understatement, especially in the matter of deserving that school
         editions have been issued for Nebraska and in the reference to approving critics.
         The approval of critics, in the aggregate, has been very great indeed. But no doubt
         it is wise to begin with a light but firm touch. I hope the poor old fellow has a
         sound streak of honor in him, but is he not self-branded as a liar?

      <p>Wm. Rose Benét of The Sat. Review might keep you. He is a powerful fan + wrote in
         his column in Sat. Rev. to the effect that my Collected Poems should have had the
         Pulitzer Prize. Very many would help were they not afraid of jeopardizing their literary
         fences. I met a lot of such when I was entertained a week by the Poetry Society in
         N.Y. a year or so ago.

      <p>Now listen to this in answer to your question: 
         <u>Don't</u> allow anyone or any fear to restrain you in the matter of speaking out boldly anything
         that you feel you can back with argument. I never do, and my column goes strong after
         more than four years. More people will thank than damn you - a lot more. 
         <u>Turn loose</u>, always first having considered your defenses. No other writing of a critical nature
         
         <del class=""></del>can be much more than interesting twaddle. Often, after turning loose in my column,
         I've hope that some one would venture to "call" me so that I might have an excuse
         for making the point clearer. Only once has this 
         <del class=""></del>happened, and golly what an advantage it gave me!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I vote for 
         <u>more</u> not less free expression from you in your magazine. 
         <u>Let loose,</u> knowing 
         <u>just</u> what you'll say if anybody gets cocky.
      </p>
