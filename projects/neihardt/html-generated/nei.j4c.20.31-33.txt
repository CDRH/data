                <p>It <u>was</u> a pleasure to hear from you again after so many years! Many thanks for your thought of me. Certainly my old-time feeling about you remains the same. You were always on the side of the angels and far ahead of your time; and what a dynamo you have been — and still are, I'm sure!</p>
                
                <p>Of course you may use the letters if they are of any value to you. I <u>wish</u> they were better ones — for your sake.</p>
                
                <p>I am in my ninth year at the University of Missouri, and

                    have been having the time of my life, for this is a fine generation of young people. I give my course, <u>Epic America</u> (upper class), twice a year. It is based on my <u>Cycle of the West</u>, and is very popular. Our difficulty is in keeping the enrollment down. Also I give two writing courses, <u>Critical Essay</u> and <u>The Writing of Poetry</u>.</p>
                
                <p>A candidate for the doctorate (in Speech) is doing her dissertation on my work. She is making extensive research and she will write you for a bit of help. I hope
