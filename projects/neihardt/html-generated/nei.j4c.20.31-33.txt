      <p>It 
         <u>was</u> a pleasure to hear from you again after so many years! Many thanks for your thought
         of me. Certainly my old-time feeling about you remains the same. You were always on
         the side of the angels and far ahead of your time; and what a dynamo you have been — and still are, I'm sure!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Of course you may use the letters if they are of any value to you. I 
         <u>wish</u> they were better ones — for your sake.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am in my ninth year at the University of Missouri, and

      <p>
         have been having the time of my life, for this is a fine generation of young people.
         I give my course, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Epic America</u>
      </p>
      <p> (upper class), twice a year. It is based on my </p>
      <p>
         <u>Cycle of the West</u>
      </p>
      <p>, and is very popular. Our difficulty is in keeping the enrollment down. Also I give
         two writing courses, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>Critical Essay</u>
      </p>
      <p> and </p>
      <p>
         <u>The Writing of Poetry</u>
      </p>
      <p>.</p>
      
      
      <p>A candidate for the doctorate (in Speech) is doing her dissertation on my work. She
         is making extensive research and she will write you for a bit of help. I hope

         you can and will help her.

      <p>What a world we have at present! Golly, golly! Mighty interesting too!</p>
