      <div class="salute">Dear Masters:- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>It is good news that the class wants me for January 9th. It will give me pleasure
         to read for them. I have no doubt that you and Long will be able to agree. I suppose
         the disagreement is over the other Omaha engagement.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I am planning that series of lectures to be given at the University in the spring. "-Not verse now, only prose"! I was
         drunk so long with the WARS, and I have now been sober since August 23rd. Really a
         terrible experience! These necessary drab delays between big jobs make me feel again
         what I meant when I wrote LET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS. But once I got well 
         <u>under</u> with the lectures I shall be fairly happy again.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>With every kind thought for yourself and Mrs. Masters,
         
      </p>
