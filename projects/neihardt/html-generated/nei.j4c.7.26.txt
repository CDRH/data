<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>


<p>"Pierrot, Bookfellow" is bully. Is it intended for a bookplate? I judge so. I wish it had been offered for the Pack.</p>

<p>Will Mosher publish the illuminated book you mention? If so, I shall have a copy.</p>

<p>Thank Mrs. Avery for letting me read the poem.</p>

<p>When you get time, I wish you'd tell me about the banquet.</p>

<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Always yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. N.

<p>Did you see the Literary Digest for May 14? The laureate business has aroused lots of comment.</p>
