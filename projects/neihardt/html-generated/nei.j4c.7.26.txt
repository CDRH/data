      <p>"Pierrot, Bookfellow" is bully. Is it intended for a bookplate? I judge so. I wish
         it had been offered for the Pack.

      <p>Will Mosher publish the illuminated book you mention? If so, I shall have a copy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thank Mrs. Avery for letting me read the poem.</p>
      
      
      <p>When you get time, I wish you'd tell me about the banquet.</p>

      <p>Did you see the Literary Digest for May 14? The laureate business has aroused lots
