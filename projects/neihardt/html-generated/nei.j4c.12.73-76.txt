      <p>Don't call it "discipline"; the use of the word makes me unhappy. In my two letters
         on the subject, I said everything that was in my mind. I know well enough that when
         you are in a position to put your whole mind on the job, you can do better notes for
         my work than anyone else could do. This is because you genuinely feel 
      </p>
      <p> the underlying meaning of the Cycle - the meaning that is not to be explained in
         words. Without that feeling any comment would be valueless. I know the notes will
         be fine. As to pay for the article you contributed to the P-D, I knew nothing about
         it. I hope they 
      </p>
      <p> paid you enough. They are really very decent. I do think you ought to have immediate
         compensation for your

         been concerned with gain. I'd really be glad to send you a check.

      <p>Walter Locke was here yesterday, asked about you, and wanted your address. So you
         will hear from him.

      <p>Mona will do the maps within the next two days, and I think I will send Brown a picture
         of Crazy Horse. Brown says he will have it reprod
         <del class=""></del>uced by their artist to correspond with the other illustrations in the book.

      <p>I do hope Macmillans may do something about our scheme for pushing the cycle. I think
         they may, and I will keep them stirred up.

      <p>The All-American Movement is developing encouragingly and something may come of it,
         with the proper management it could be made a very great success. Soon I will send
         you material that will explain

         be very profitable.
