<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>Don't call it "discipline"; the use of the word makes me unhappy. In my two letters on the subject, I said everything that was in my mind. I know well enough that when you are in a position to put your whole mind on the job, you can do better notes for my work than anyone else could do. This is because you genuinely feel <del/> the underlying meaning of the Cycle - the meaning that is not to be explained in words. Without that feeling any comment would be valueless. I know the notes will be fine. As to pay for the article you contributed to the P-D, I knew nothing about it. I hope they <del/> paid you enough. They are really very decent.

    time and effort spent on the notes. I know well enough that your interest has never been concerned with gain. I'd really be glad to send you a check.</p>

<p>Walter Locke was here yesterday, asked about you, and wanted your address. So you will hear from him.</p>

<p>Mona will do the maps within the next two days, and I think I will send Brown a picture of Crazy Horse. Brown says he will have it reprod<del/>uced by their artist to correspond with the other illustrations in the book.</p>

<p>I do hope Macmillans may do something about our scheme for pushing the cycle. I think they may, and I will keep them stirred up.</p>

<p>The All-American Movement is developing encouragingly and something may come of it, with the proper management it could be made a very great success. Soon I will send you material that will explain <del/>
