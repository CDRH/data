      <p>I've just run across your letter of Nov. 19th again. I answered it, but it makes me
         want to tell you again that I love you. The feeling that has been between us so long
         is one of the finest things that can happen in this world, and whenever I think of
         it, I am glorified.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Please give me the latest news about the Book. I do hope that Simon &amp; Schuster will
         want it, for they are pushers &amp; know how. It would give me immense satisfaction if
         the book should "succeed" in the worldly way. For your spiritual development, you
         may not need that, but I'd love to know that such satisfaction had come to you — and,
         of course, it would be a heartening experience. Who knows? You 
         
         <u>can</u> truly write, as I've often told you, — which means that first of all, you can 
         
         <u>see humanly</u>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Things go very well here. I lectured at U. of Iowa &amp; Grinnell College recently. Mona
         went along &amp; we had a bully time together. I may be invited to lecture at Iowa through
         the summer sessions. I like the place.

         Norman Foerster (formerly of U. of N. C., Chapel Hill) is now head of the Dept. of
         Letters. He suggested my coming.

      <p>Dr. Conn is dead in California. It is glorious to die when one's work is done, &amp; to
         go with honor. But poor Mrs. Conn! It will kill her.
