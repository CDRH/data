Dr. J. T. House,

New River State School,

Montgomery, West Va.

<span class="salute">Dear Dr. House:</span>

<p>I am very much interested indeed in the magazine which you are going to publish, "Current American Literature." There is a need for a publication of this sort, and I think you are well qualified to undertake its editorship.</p>

<p>I am glad to send you at once a complete set of Edwin Arlington Robinson in the new five volume edition which we are just publishing; also the Neihardt short stories, and THE RIVER AND I; also Lindsay's COLLECTED POEMS, and such of his prose work as we publish.</p>

<p>You speak of Charles and Mary Beard. I think probably you would like THE RISE OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION. I am sending that to you as well. Will you not keep me in touch with the progress of your work, and let me see the first issue of the magazine?</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Cordially yours,</span>

<br/>H.S. Latham
