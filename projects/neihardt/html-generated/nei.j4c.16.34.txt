      <div class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn: </div>
      
      
      <p>I delayed writing you because I was waiting to hear from Peru and Kearney. I have
         now heard favorably from both.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Peru wants me on the 15th of July and I judge that Kearney can take me toward the
         end of July on my return from the north.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It seems best now that I should go direct to you from Peru, arriving there sometime
         in the afternoon of the 16th. Could you use me at this time?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It is good to know that President Elliott wants me at Chadron again.</p>
