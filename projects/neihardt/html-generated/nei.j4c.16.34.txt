<span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>

<p>I delayed writing you because I was waiting to hear from Peru and Kearney. I have now heard favorably from both.</p>
                
<p>Peru wants me on the 15th of July and I judge that Kearney can take me toward the end of July on my return from the north.</p>
                
<p>It seems best now that I should go direct to you from Peru, arriving there sometime in the afternoon of the 16th. Could you use me at this time?</p>
                
<p>It is good to know that President Elliott wants me at Chadron again.</p>

<span class="salute">With kind thoughts,</span>
