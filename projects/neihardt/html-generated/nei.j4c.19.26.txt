      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour: </div>
      
      
      <p>I've just read yours of yesterday in which you mention The Alliance Book Corp as at
         least a possibility, and offer to send a classified directory.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It has struck me that the only way for me to find out is to go and see, and I could
         get a lot done in a few days. So I've just about decided to run up there for a few
         days and 
         <del class=""></del> see what I can see.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I may be able to get away in time to have a visit with you on Sunday.</p>
