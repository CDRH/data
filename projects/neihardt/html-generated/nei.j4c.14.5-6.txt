<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>I have become well acquainted with a Philippine poet, <u>M. de Gracia Concepion</u>, who is now on his way to Manilla. Yesterday I asked him to do an article for you on Philippine poetry, giving a number of representative things to be published therewith. He was eager to do it, and no doubt he has written you, as he promised to do. This should make a rather good feature, I should think. Of course, I told him there's no payment, and he was glad to throw in with your sort of magazine.</p>

<p>I must send that article on Tolerance this week end.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

<br/>Jno.
</span>

<p>Perhaps you will want to devote most of a number to Concepcion's stuff.</p>
