      <div class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly: </div>
      
      
      <p>I want this to reach you before you start for Minneapolis. I had an office in the
         old Journal bldg on 4th St from Sep 1, 
      </p>
      <p> 1912, to March 1 (I believe) 1913. During this time I ran a weekly page. After that
         I did my work (a 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>weekly</u>
      </p>
      <p> column) in Bancroft, and, after 1921, in Branson. Be sure to go over the </p>
      <p>
         <u>weekly page</u>
      </p>
      <p> first. There must be some amusing ones in this group, as I recall how old H. V. Jones
         used to come into my office chuckling to say, " Well, you had another hot one!" I
         remember "Sentimental Geometry" and

         "Wanted: A Barrel of Arnica"; but there must have been a considerable number. I think
         there may

      <p>
         <u>be</u>
      </p>
      <p> some on the outburst of impressionism in 1912. That would be the early beginning
         of my thesis which was elaborated in the Journal-Post and, most of all, in the Post-Dispatch.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You mention my "reading" to the children. It was 
         <u>recitation</u>. I used to "sing poetry" to them, as they called it. "Sing poetry, Daddy; sing poetry".
         I did a lot of that.

      <p>Did you find the verses to Davis, ending "Of you, 'tis, I'll be thinking when I blow
         off the foam"? I vaguely recall those you mention.

      <p> Nature knows nothing of morals — an obvious fact that in no way lessens the social
         value of morality or the spiritual value either. Beneath the troubled surface there
         are the unchanging depths — the universal mother — the
