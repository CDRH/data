      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I think I wrote you last from Austin, and that is a deuce of a long time between times.
         Your second letter since my last arrived today, and I could hardly believe at first
         that I had not written you. Things have been moving in a rapid excited way for me,
         and I hardly know which way to jump, for there are three good ways to jump. Here is
         the situation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have been giving nearly all my time to the J-P of Kansas City at what is really
         a ridiculous salary. 
         <div class="note">($40 per wk.)</div> I was doing this, however, by way of winning out in Kansas City and getting a nucleus
         for a syndicate
         <del class=""></del>. The syndicate idea is working out nicely, and I could have from eighty to a hundred
         dollars here - that is, per week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When I was in Lincoln several weeks ago, Avery offered me a full professorship (active,
         to begin Sept. first), and his proposition was good. He suggested two lectures per
         week and a seminar. For this I was to receive half pay of a full professor, that is
         $2250. I can go there if I want to go, and the plan was that I should run my syndicate
         and give a course on Contemporary Literature, based on my reviewing. Avery was strong
         for this and so was Sherman. Sherman has written me a long letter, setting forth his
         ideas of what I should do up there. I was surprised to note that he had a lecture
         a day in mind.

         Post-Dispatch into our syndicate. Leigh Leslie of Omaha, who has been travelling for
         the syndicate on Judge Vinsonhaler's money, met me in St. Louis last Thursday, and
         we went to see the editor of the Post-Dispatch. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <div class="note">Leslie had been there before on my business.</div>
      </p>
      <p> He had us to lunch, and it looked mighty good - almost a cinch, we thought. The Post-Dispatch,
         however, would prefer to have me for its own man, and wipe out the syndicate idea.
         $100 per week was mentioned by the editor, and I would be required to live in the
         suburbs of St. Louis. This job would giv
      </p>
      <p>
         <del class="v">v</del>
      </p>
      <p>e me, with my </p>
      <p>royalties, over $6,000 per year, without counting occasional lectures. And the best
         part of it is that I would be expected to write no more than two columns per week.
         My job would be editing the book page, for most of the material would be contributed.
         Johns, the editor,
      </p>
      <p>
         <del class="has">has</del>
      </p>
      <p> asked me to write him my notion of a good book page and to send my Journal-Post pages.
         He himself is sold, it appears. He wants this stuff for Pulitzer, who was not in town.
         I should know soon, for I must either accept or reject the University offer. There
         will be a quick decision, I was given to understand.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If I go to St. Louis to live, I can work five mornings of the week at home on the
         MESSIAH, and my God, that is what I want to do and must do. Two mornings would be
         spent at home writing on my P-D stuff, and all afternoons would be s
      </p>
      <p>pent at my office in town. I have a Buick master-six, and could drive in, even though
         I should live out 15 miles, as Jonhs thought I might well do. I had to have that car.
         It was 
         
         
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">-3-</h6>
      <h6 class="fw">48</h6>
      <p>
         necessary if I stayed here, as we'd have to go to Springfield once a week for
      </p>
      <p> music lessons. If we leave, it will be more necessary, if possible. I got an astonishing
         bargain on the car, and it's a moose. I drove to Eureka Springs and back with eight
         in it the other day, and the hills are terrible. The damned beautiful thing purred
         up nearly all hills. Yesterday I made the Cave trip, another hard drive; and the performance
         of the beast was superb. I have a new car guarantee - 90 days, and I know the man
         who sold it to me. He's honest. It is almost new and looks like a brand new car. But
         the price was much lower than on a new car.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>So I may not be so very far from you next winter.</p>
      
      
      <p>My royalties took a bounce this year. $1,028. Increase in sales all around, really
         extraordinary, and I'm delighted.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The more I think of it, the more I want to get hold of that Post-Dispatch page. The
         P-D is one of the best papers in the U.S. and has weight all over the country. Also,
         it is absolutely free in opinion. The editor said: "I want you to understand one thing
         now: there would be no commercializing on that page". And I said, "You could not get
         me to commercialize it for all Pulitzer's money". So there would no row there.
