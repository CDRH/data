      <p>I've been back from my vacation a week and am in fine shape -- better than for years.
         Things are progressing in a most satisfactory manner, and I wish we could be together
         to talk things over. I can tell so little in letters.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>That last issue of the Quarterly 
         <u>was</u> bully. You are doing something worthy, and I hope it makes you moderately happy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Penn State experience was illuminating to me. The effect of Poetic Values surprised
         me. I had mature people.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wonder when we can meet. We 
         <del class=""></del>
         <u>need</u> a conference soon. I must lecture at Wellesley Oct. 23rd, and several nearby places. Maybe I can stop on the way and see you!
