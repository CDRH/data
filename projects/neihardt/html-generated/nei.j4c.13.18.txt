<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>I've been back from my vacation a week and am in fine shape -- better than for years. Things are progressing in a most satisfactory manner, and I wish we could be together to talk things over. I can tell so little in letters.</p>

<p>That last issue of the Quarterly <u>was</u> bully. You are doing something worthy, and I hope it makes you moderately happy.</p>

<p>The Penn State experience was illuminating to me. The effect of Poetic Values surprised me. I had mature people.</p>

<p>I wonder when we can meet. We <del/><u>need</u> a conference soon. I must lecture at Wellesley Oct. 23rd, and several nearby places. Maybe I can stop on the way and see you!</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

<br/>Jno.
