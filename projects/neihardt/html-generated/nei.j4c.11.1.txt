      <p>That was a fine blast in BOOKS. It is honest, and I greatly admire your reserve. There
         is far too much falsetto in our "criticism". I shall not thank you, as we both know
         that this is no log-rolling bee.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm glad you said that about reprinting THE RIVER AND I. You are right. Of course,
         Macmillans would do it if I were to insist, but now I am hoping they may suggest reprinting
         without my saying anything about it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have little interest in my work here, for I see no opportunity for doing anything
         worthy. The column technique is not mine, as I need not tell you. I wanted to make
         this a really important mouthpiece for you men all over the West who have a right
         to express literary opinions. It was a great scheme and entirely feasible. But they
         want "newsy" stuff here. I may have to serve my year out, as I am bound by contract;
         but no more after that. Furthermore, contrary to my understanding when I agreed to
         come here, all my time is required in the office. That would be fatal. It is a sad
         affair, for the moment; and my income does not modify my happiness. I don't want as
         much money as I am making now - somewhere about $7500. I don't need it, even with
         my growing family. But I shall know how to save myself.
