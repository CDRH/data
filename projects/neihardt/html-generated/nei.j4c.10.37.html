      <p>Thanks for the letters. Many thanks for the labor at McGregor! Too bad you had so
         small a crowd. I had reason to suppose that you would have a goodly gathering. Now
         I am sorry I urged you to go. I certainly do not like to see you wasted.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am connected in an honorary way with a number of poetry magazines, the best of which
         is the quarterly, VERSE, of Philadelphia. It pays real money for verse, and it seems
         to me to be the best all-poetry magazine in the country. I shall have nothing to give
         it, of course; but I want to help along. Surely you, Mrs. Masters, have some things
         you could let me see. And would not our friend who wrote "Roof Pigeons" send me a
         bunch of things? Also, if you ever run across good verse, let me know.
      </p>
