                <span class="salute">Dear Bower:</span>
                
                <p>I was very glad to receive your good letter, and I read it eagerly with satisfaction.</p>
                
                <p>When I think of you and Mrs. Aly, I have a <u>happy, safe feeling</u>, and I could not say more with many words. There is <u>pattern</u> in this relationship, I know; and it is all good.</p>
                
                <p>I understand and respect the limitations of a dissertation, and I have been admiring the results obtained by exact methods of research. I note that the point I emphasized is well taken by Mrs. A. in her latest letter. It

                    is this: When the available documentation does not indicate the <u>known truth</u>, either more documents must be found or the insufficient material must be used in such a way as to 
                    <u>indicate</u> the <u>more</u> that is <u>known</u>, or at least to guard against false inference. There is no back thought at all in this statement. I note in Mrs. A's letter that it is accepted as obvious. I believe an adroit change in the wording might be enough, in most cases.</p>
                
                <p>In my voluminous comments, I was talking on paper, and much of what I said applied only to the <del>biography</del> proposed biography. This could be confusing, since I was commenting

                    on the dissertation; but as points came up, I discussed them, fearing that I might not be around when the biography could be helped by the remarks. I'm sure all this is well understood. In face-to-face conversation it could all be cleared up in a few words back and forth.</p>
                
                <p>About the letters and the Huntington Library: I agree, and I'm most appreciative of your interest. I hope your generosity does not exceed the worth of my work — or, let's say — <u>the</u> work. I choose to believe that somehow you are justified. Anyway, bless your heart!</p>

                    <p>Dr. Moffett and I have our desks side by side, and we talk "about it and about"! I mentioned your desire to have the letters in the Huntington Library, and he said, "Fine! If we can have photo-stats here". So let's go ahead and see what happens. If Huntington is agreeable, should letters from the M. U. collection be included? I'd favor that also. I'll ask my daughter, Enid, and her husband, Oliver Fink, how they'd feel about the plan.</p>
