      <p>Your most welcome letter reached me just after I had mailed one to you today. No,
         I'm not
         sick; but I'm tearing my damned shirt. Have just now finished galley 113 of 
         <u>Collected Poems</u>, leaving over 50 more to read.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It will be great news when I hear that you've completed the book. How bully to go
         again
         to Washington! And after that job is finished, you'll do another good one - 
         <u>Man and Poet</u>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm glad you still find the page interesting. Things look promising for the syndicate.
         I'll report later on that.
      </p>
