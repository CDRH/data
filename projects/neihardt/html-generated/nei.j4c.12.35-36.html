      <p>It has just struck me that you are very likely to be in New York, since Mary will
         be going there soon. If you do go there, would it not be a good thing for you to have
         a seance with Mr. Latham and Dr. Brown regarding a connection with Macmillans when
         you are ready to make it? So much more can be done by talk then by letter, and I am
         sure you would be persuasive. This was brought up once, and as I remember it, Latham
         thought the suggestion was "feasible". Golly! With you travelling for Macmillans,
         great things could be done! Before that time you would have the "Man and Poet" ready.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Everything going finely.</p>
