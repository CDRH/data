      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      <p>I have the proofs of the Pack. Will get them back to you within a week.</p>
      
      
      <p>George Sterling ought to be represented. It happens that he has just sent me a sheaf
         of unpublished poems — a way he has of doing with me. They are all Sterlingesque,
         and therefore exquisite. Do you mind if I arrange to include one or two of his poems?
         I think I can manage it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, some of Starret might be left out. His work was so far above the mass of material
         sent me that I couldn't reject any of it. I was thinking only of merit. Several rather
         piffling things were included in order to increase the number of authors.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'll indicate the Starrett poems that may be cut out.</p>
      
      
      <p>I know you now — you are John S. Brown! I enjoyed that stuff a lot, and it was never
         a question as to whether or not the two Brown pieces should be retained.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, I'll send on the Laureate Address. Two short and rather excellent speeches were
         made (one by Dean L. A. Sherman, the Shakespeare scholar) before I turned loose with
         my address. How would it do to include these? Considering the fact that the whole
         laureate affair 
         <del class="was">was</del>is unique in America, I should think it might be well to publish the lecture as the
         laureate Address with the introductory speeches.
      </p>

         <br></br>J.G.N.
          
      </div>
      
      
      
      <p>The 
         <u>Pack</u> impresses me much more favorably in print than in MS.
