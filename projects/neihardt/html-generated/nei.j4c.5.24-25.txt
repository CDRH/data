<span class="salute">Dear Sinclair: —</span>

	<p>I worked but a short time at the news end of the journalistic game, and that was eighteen years ago; so I cannot give any testimony as to suppression of news. Wish I could, for I know well that it is going on merrily.</p>
	<p>Of course, a book may be regarded as news; and I could tell something in that direction, but am not free to do so yet. I have never been asked to lie about a book, but I have been forced to keep quiet more than once, lest that I might "drive away advertising". Lately no books regarded as dangerous are sent to me.</p>

	<p>If the new St. Paul paper takes me, I shall be free to tell all the truth.</p>
	<p>Boni &amp; Liveright sent me a copy of Jimmie Higgins lately, and I suppose I am indebted to you for it. If so, I am very grateful. I have read it, and it is certainly powerful. Why in the world is it allowed to circulate? I hope to be able to write a review of it for some paper.</p>

<span class="salute">With all kind thoughts,</span>
<span class="salute">Yours,</span>
<br/>Jno. Neihardt
