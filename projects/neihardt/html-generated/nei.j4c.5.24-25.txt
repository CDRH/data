      <div class="salute">Dear Sinclair: — </div>
      
      	
      <p>I worked but a short time at the news end of the journalistic game, and that was eighteen
         years ago; so I cannot give any testimony as to suppression of news. Wish I could,
         for I know well that it is going on merrily.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Of course, a book may be regarded as news; and I could tell something in that direction,
         but am not free to do so yet. I have never been asked to lie about a book, but I have
         been forced to keep quiet more than once, lest that I might "drive away advertising".
         Lately no books regarded as dangerous are sent to me.
      </p>

      <p>If the new St. Paul paper takes me, I shall be free to tell all the truth.</p>
      	
      <p>Boni &amp; Liveright sent me a copy of Jimmie Higgins lately, and I suppose I am indebted
         to you for it. If so, I am very grateful. I have read it, and it is certainly powerful.
         Why in the world is it allowed to circulate? I hope to be able to write a review of
         it for some paper.
