      <p>I believe that a series of articles on your pioneer experiences would make an excellent
         feature for the magazine, &amp; I hope you will go ahead. Such memories are decidedly
         worth recording and you will do it with a warmth of feeling that will make them come
         alive.

      <p>The enclosed shows how Morrows are going at their job. You may shove it into your
         next letter.
