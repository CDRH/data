                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>I hope to send you a book for review today, and hereafter I'd like to send one a week.</p>
                
                <p>I must tell you that the wave of reaction which has swept the country has left us anything but free here. We are not expected to say anything reactionary ourselves, but we cannot attack the capitalist system any more; so you will have to forget about the social problem except in a rather general way. I saw this coming as early as 1934. Anyone could have seen it if he had the necessary data.</p>
                
                <p>Don't interpret this to mean that the Post has in any way "sold out". It has not. It is simply compelled to be wise under the circumstances. Bovard, our managing editor, is a real radical, and we have had several interesting talks about this matter.</p>
                
                <p>No more now.</p>
