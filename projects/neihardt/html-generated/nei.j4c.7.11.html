      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I have a lecture on "Poetry and its Place in Education" that I gave before the Nebraska
         State Teachers' Association two years ago. Since then I have read it at a number of
         colleges and universities of the West. I have had extraordinarily good success with
         it, and wherever I have given it many have asked where it could be gotten in print.
         Dr. A. W. Small of Chicago University took it for the American Journal of Sociology
         over a year ago, but it has not yet appeared, though I am told it will probably be
         used soon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It has struck me that the Bookfellows might want to issue it. I supposed that Macmillans
         would bring it out if I cared to offer it, but the thought of giving it to the Bookfellows
         is rather pleasing to me. It contains 8,000 words.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Do you see anything in the suggestion?</p>
      
      
      <div class="closer">
         
         <div class="salute">Yours, </div>
         
         
         <br></br>Jno. Neihardt
          
      </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I tried to pack into an hour's talk some of the things I have thought about poetry
         during a quarter of a century of devotion to the subject.

      <div class="note">You ask if there's any book on your "list" I want. I am a book-glutton, and I always
         take them when offered. Make it a copy of your "
         <u>Adventures</u> etc."
