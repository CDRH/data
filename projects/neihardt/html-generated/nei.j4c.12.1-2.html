      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Johns - the big boss under Mr. Pulitzer - was in my office a little while ago
         and stayed about a half hour just talking about everything pleasant. Incidentally
         he said that the Sunday editor had spoken to him about the article you proposed to
         write on my stuff. He asked what I thought about running it somehow in connection
         with my column. I told him I thought that would be wrong, that if any article should
         be accepted, it ought to be used as a Sunday story. I told him that you are the editor
         of my school editions, and he seemed not to have known. It interested him a good deal.
         I told him not to feel that he ought to run an article on me and my work, and he said
         he couldn't see why the P-D should ignore the work of its own men. He gave the Sunday
         editor orders to have you submit an article. So I am supposing that you will hear
         soon. Perhaps you have heard already.
      </p>

         <br></br>Jno.
          
      </div>
      
      <p>Johns seems to have no notion that I am thoroughly happy and satisfied. Certainly
         the whole bunch treats me with great respect and kindness. Perhaps, for the time,
         I should take it all differently.
