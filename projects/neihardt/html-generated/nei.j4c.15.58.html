         On the supposition, which may be wrong, that no one 
         <del class=""></del> on the staff would be free to take over the work, 
         <del class="which requires">which requires</del> I would suggest Dr. Julius T. House of New River State College, West Va., who 
         <del class="[edit?]">edit</del> for several years has edited &amp; published "Present Day American Literature", one of the best of the
         independent magazines. Dr. House is a Chicago University man with a rich cultural
         background and with special training in Sociology. His general outlook is in perfect agreement with that which
