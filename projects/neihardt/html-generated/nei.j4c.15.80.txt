      <p>Just a word to say that I'm happy about your Nov. number. The Robinson article is
         a shrewd and really penetrating bit of criticism, I believe. Fair and kindly, too.
         It's a bull's eye shot, no doubt.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>And the installment of the Sentimental Journey is corkingly good, with the note in
         it I wanted to hear.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The book has aroused a lot enthusiasm. Macmillans have written me 3 urgent letters,
         asking to publish it. They heard of it by accident. Amusing.
