      <p>I am glad you cared about the review and hope it may do some good. I assure you it
         is not my habit to overpraise. I rather love an honest "roast"—especially when the
         subject is concerned with some of our too common sentimental gush and slipshod thinking.
         Lord! But aren't there a lot of make-believes amongst us! Therefor my article about
         what struck me as an honest book. Of course, you won't reach the Philistine — and
         who cares? If you get a fair amount of enjoyment out of being yourself and writing
         the truth as you see it, in a beautiful way—that's about all you can expect. Here
         &amp; there will be found quiet thinkers who will care about your work, though only a
         small percentage will even let you know.

         I took him up four years ago. He was reading Henty and other similar concoctions!
         how he knows a great many of the classics. The other day he went to work on a farm
         with a copy of Murray's Oedipus in his pocket!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Your essay sums up all I have tried to breathe into him—and so I gave it to him. Well,
         that one boy is something of an audience!
