      <p>Look in library for 
         <u>The Young Idea</u> by Morris (Duffield &amp; Co., N. Y. 1917). In this I was ranked with Robinson and others
         as a traditionalist. It's a 
         <u>tug</u> needing comment. My insistence 
         <u>was</u> and 
         <u>is</u> on the fact that we are what we are because of what men have thought, felt &amp; done
         from the beginning; that our roots are in the past. Literature, as life itself, is
         organic. Creative continuation is the thing! 
         <u>Not imitation</u>!
