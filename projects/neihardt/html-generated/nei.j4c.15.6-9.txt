      <p>By now you have the introductory portion of THE MESSIAH.</p>
      
      
      <p>It was bully to hear from you again. Sorry sickness had to interfere with your good
         time with Mary and her good man and blessed baby.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Swat Pattee in any way you think may be effective and 
         <u>that will give you the greatest satisfaction. We</u> aren't worried anyway. Time is a great friend of ours, and we should not forget it.
         The New York mood is ridiculous in any long view, and it is far from omnipotent, even
         in our loud and foolish moment. There is no good reason to worry about the ultimate
         
         <del class=""></del>destiny of my little 
         <div class="note">destiny</div> contribution to this world. Scarcely a week passes in which I do not receive evidence
         of the high standing of my work out through the country from coast to coast. Very
         commonly it is assumed in the letters I receive that I (hateful and foolish symbol
         in this connection) am either "the greatest" or one of the greatest poets, etc. In
         the course of any year, the evidence of this sort is really rather impressive and
         it comes from any part of the country, certainly not excluding New York. It is not
         a loud reputation, but clearly it is solid and growing. I don't conceive that 
         <u>I</u> am the thisest or the thatest anything whatever, for I do not believe that art is
         to be conceived as a foot race; but through what is temporarily called me, more and
         of deeper meaning has come than through all but a very few other names. This at the
         least is true. You need not feel in the least on the defensive in your articles. But
         give a poor fool his just dues for fun and perhaps for the good of a few misguided
         souls generally.

         <div class="note">Our friend, George Sterling — who, bless him, won peace — once remarked to me when
            Harriet's name was mentioned: "John I fear - I very much fear - that the lady is a
            
            <del class=""></del>virgin!"
         </div> No, I have 
         <u>not</u> Harriet's screeds. God forbid that I should cherish such things! I am sending another
         booklet as you ask. Anything that you care to do about this matter will be amusing
         to me — and gratifying.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A pompous fool is always fair game for the intelligent, and I should say that the
         hunting is rather good just now!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The great idea now is for me to live through this winter and get going with the Sioux
         pow-wows 
         <div class="note">follow</div> in the spring. Everything will 
         <del class=""></del>follow naturally thereafter. There will always be fine spirits in this world, even after
         — and perhaps 
         <u>especially</u> after — a large proportion of our population has been wiped out in the catastrophe
         that is approaching.

      <p>I have a really brillant idea for your magazine during the coming year. Listen — 
         <u>are you listening?</u> Well, this is it: Run a series of articles, with excerpts, on genuine American poets
         who are temporarily neglected! It's a corking idea &amp; a glorious one! To begin with,
         take Trumbull Stickney, Arthur Upson, Madison Cawein! I've got dope on Upson for you
         — real dope. And on the others — and still others — if you insist; 
         <u>and you will insist</u>! This is worth doing. We can make the Spoon number a veritable whale! Ask me how
         &amp; I'll testify!!
