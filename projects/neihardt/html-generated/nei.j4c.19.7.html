      <p>What a fine-looking family, and what's better, fine as you look! Mona and I were genuinely
         pleased to have a look at all of you. Many thanks for remembering us.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"The Song of Jed Smith" is nearing completion. Macmillans have wanted it for May publication,
         but any dead line would stop me. So it will definitely appear in Sept. I should be
         through in Feb.

      <p>Mona and I made a lecture trip to Boulder and Denver in Oct., returning 
         <del class="up">up</del>down the Platte to Wayne. Thought of you but had to hurry.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>We are both still impressed with the fine work you did on the biographical study.
         Too bad the State committee 
         <span class="">[flubed?]</span>! But, who knows? The thing may yet appear in complete form, 
         <u>after</u> the Cycle is out in a single volume.
