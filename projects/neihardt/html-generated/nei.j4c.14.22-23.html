      <p>I troubled you with a long letter yesterday which was not of a very constructive nature;
         but I have something more pleasant to talk about this morning.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I believe that the STRAWS IN THE WIND ought to come out very soon and I know that
         this belief is based upon no secret springs of vanity in me, though there are plenty
         of these no doubt. For obvious reasons such a book of criticism can not be handled
         in the East. No publisher would care to risk offending his supporting cliques. I rather
         think the University of Oklahoma Press would be interested. Something very vital is
         going on over there in Norman and the University Press does remarkable things. The
         STRAWS should appear in such a definitely American community. By advertising it in
         the Post, I think a fair number of copies would sell in Post territory, though God
         knows St. Louis is dark enough. My question is this: To what extent do you think you
         could aid in pushing the STRAWS, which contains the best of my articles over a period
         of nearly five years? Don't let your generosity make you go too strong on this. Just
         tell me what seems possible without taking any special burden on yourself. The time
         will come, perhaps very rapidly, when the value of this book will be painfully apparent
         to anyone who can relate causes and consequences, and I hate to think of the manuscript's lying idle.
      </p>

      <p>I have a plan for assuming a fair portion of the risk if this should seem necessary.
         I do not want you to consider 
         <em>any</em> 
         <u>financial risk</u> whatever.
