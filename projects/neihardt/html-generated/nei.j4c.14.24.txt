      <p>Hurrah for the new Grandfather! How 
         <u>does</u> it feel? Rather glorious, I'd say. We received a happy wire and returned one at once.
         What a relief for all of you to have it over! I judged that all was well when the
         wire was sent.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, when you can find time approach Pattee, setting forth the points I made in my
         three letters and others that occur to you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You shall have the Messiah lines. When is zero hour for the Jan. number.</p>
