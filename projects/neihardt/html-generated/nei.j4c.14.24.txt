<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p>Hurrah for the new Grandfather! How <u>does</u> it feel? Rather glorious, I'd say. We received a happy wire and returned one at once. What a relief for all of you to have it over! I judged that all was well when the wire was sent.</p>
                
<p>Yes, when you can find time approach Pattee, setting forth the points I made in my three letters and others that occur to you.</p>
                
<p>You shall have the Messiah lines. When is zero hour for the Jan. number.</p>
        <span class="closer">
