      <div class="salute">Dear Mott:- </div>
      
      
      <p>Just home from a month's trip. Glad to get your letter. Macmillan's contract for my
         COLLECTED POEMS was on my desk when I reached home. Evidently they are eager to close.
      </p>
      
      <p>Yes indeed, I shall see that you get an advance copy of THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS,
         if possible. At any rate, you shall have one of the first copies.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I congratulate you (and the readers of the Midland) upon your joint-editorship! That's
         bully! I will subscribe. Put me down now and send bill.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm in a frightful rush with letters, but this carries every good wish.
         
      </p>

      <p>My wife was glad to be remembered and sends greetings.</p>
