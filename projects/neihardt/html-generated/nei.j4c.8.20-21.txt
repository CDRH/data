      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:- </div>
      
      
      <p>After receiving the page from Goodspeed's catalog of autographs, I set to figuring,
         and I find, after figuring all night, that my friends owe me nigh onto $750,000. However,
         I shall postpone suit, as I look for a rising market. In the meanwhile, being a shrewd
         and far-seeing man, I withhold signatures.

      <p>Note by a collector in the year 2022:</p>
      
      
      <p>This is one of Neihardt's alleged humorous notes so highly prized by collectors. It is said that Mr. Seymour sold it
         for 35¢, thus sacrificing the friendship of the Doctor, who was a very shrewd and
         far-seeing man.
