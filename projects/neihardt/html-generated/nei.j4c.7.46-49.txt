      <p>Anything sourish is best for my liver; but in the Volsteadian age most anything goes.</p>
      
      
      <p>I didn't make my meaning clear in the matter of "small town" fiction. What I object
         to is the assumption that there is a distinct small town mind. I say that is a fiction.
         What is mistaken for the small town mind may be found anywhere. There was once a rural
         type of mind, but it's been shot all to hell by newspapers, magazines, movies, autos,
         telephones, rural routes etc.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wish to God I could review in the sea with you. I want to learn some practical things
         from you, and I know you could teach me. Do you find fresh-water swimming much more
         difficult than salt-water swimming? Also, I'd probably have a hell of a good time
         in salt water, for fresh water is all I know, and it seems pretty easy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How </p>

         <em>did</em>
      </p>
      <p> you manage to write a poem of that length without getting at least one "goose in
         the

         What Powys said of "Lilith" doesn't strike me as funny at all. I believe he's right.
         Your stuff stands a mighty good show of surviving for two reasons, excellent reasons.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I've been reading too much along with my other work, &amp; day before yesterday I went
         to pieces. Thought it was "flu", but it was stomach, bowels, nerves, eye-strain. I
         read 12 books in 7 days besides writing reviews &amp; working on "The Indian Wars". Am
         a bit wobbly yet today, but I'm coming around &amp; getting my tail up again.

         <br></br>Jno.

      <p>Don't gather from what I said that I think I'm some swimmer. I'm just a fair dub,
         doing what I do easily; but dozens of youngsters here are better than I am. I can
         do less with the breast stroke than with any other, except the crawl which I don't
         know well. The over-arm side stroke seems to me the fastest, most powerful. The Trudgen
         is nice for a change, but it tires me sooner than the side overarm.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Did you ever hear of "web-hands" for swimmers?  I got the idea this summer. Works
         too. Adds power to stroke.
