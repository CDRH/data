      <p>I'm sorry I asked you to do that brief article for the booklet. I find it won't be
         necessary, as the press stuff can be arranged to tell the story, and I doubt if Macmillans
         can use all I have prepared for them from reviews. Of course I quote freely from your
         Sat. Rev. of Lit. article.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'll tell Latham, when I send the stuff, that probably you would be able to furnish
         any additional material he might want.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Sorry I bothered you, and hope you haven't done my work on the article.</p>
      
      
      <p>Things are booming. I'm doing my best for the Journal-Post, six columns per week.
         First installment appears March 7th. I've done two installments.

         And Messiah is growing rapidly and most satisfactorily. The University Extension Center
         of K.C. wants me for a series of four lectures next season, and Redpath-Harner is
         on my trail. So things move.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I forgot to order those new copies of Friends - Glass for you until this minute. I'll
         do it at once.

      <p>I'm writing for Sat. Review of Lit. too - occasionally only, of course; but they keep
         asking me again. Very nice connection. Did they pay you for your review of me? You
         had about $12 coming. It's mostly honor, but they do pay 
         <u>fair</u> rates.
