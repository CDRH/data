<span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>



<p>Where are you, what are you doing — and what the deuce, anyway? It's been long since I heard from you. I wonder if you are in the Army. Have just been reading Chas. Warren Stoddard's Poems, with your fine tribute in the front.</p>

<p>I'm still toiling away on "The Song of Three Friends". Over 1500 lines now. Can't finish until in February. Good luck!</p>

<span class="salute">Affectionately</span>
<br/>John Neihardt
