      <p>Where are you, what are you doing — and what the deuce, anyway? It's been long since
         I heard from you. I wonder if you are in the Army. Have just been reading Chas. Warren
         Stoddard's Poems, with your fine tribute in the front.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm still toiling away on "The Song of Three Friends". Over 1500 lines now. Can't
         finish until in February. Good luck!
      </p>
