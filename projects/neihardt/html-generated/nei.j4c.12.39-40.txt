      <p>Bully to hear from you. I told you in my last of Hodge's Handbook of American Indians.
         That will give you information on individuals and their careers.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The "white chief" who went down "feathered like a goose" was undoubtedly Fetterman
         himself, + you may so state.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Am feeling fairly well again.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have had our house in Branson made 
         <u>new</u>. Its a dandy. The men have worked 4 weeks on it + it is nearly finished.
