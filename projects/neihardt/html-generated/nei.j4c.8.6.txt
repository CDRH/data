      <p>I've seen your article in the Register. Good work! I am glad to have it said that
         I do not pose. In fact I haven't any platform manner. If my poetry is worth hearing,
         I win. If it is not worth hearing, I lose.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It seems that the committee wants, or thinks it wants, a miscellaneous program</p>
      <p>, some lyrics, some of the "Friends", some of the "Wars". There's the spirit of modern
         America. What do you think? Should I give all the time to either the "Friends" or
         the "Wars", 
         
      </p>

      <p>
         or should I give a taste of one of the narratives and fill out with lyrics? Think
         this over, keeping the audience in mind, and be prepared to advise me. Please.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm eager to see you again.</p>

      <p>The lyrics always get across, for that matter, and I like to read them! But isn't
         the epic the thing now? And I judge that the audience will be unusually intelligent.
