      <div class="salute">My dear Mr. Davis:— </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>I have just been thinking, since receiving yours
         of the 6th, how fortunate it is to have a man, whom one has
         never seen, trying to discover one! I have conceived such
         a feeling of gratitude toward you that is my intention to
         keep hammering away at you, that you may be the man who finds
         me, if I ever find myself.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>Sometimes, this every day endeavoring to force a trumpet—
         cry out of the throat of a gnat seems humorous to me. I have
         long walks in which I laugh at myself— then I come back and
         go at it again.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>Today I had a walk, and the result of it is recorded here:</p>

            <div class="l">I'm a yelling for to be found out: </div>

      <p>All of which proves that all the good poems were 
         <u>not</u>
         written by Alfred Austin. You will notice with what consummate
         mastery I have used repetition in the final lines of each
         stanza, producing a sort of battering ram effect, and fairly
         beating it into the head of the awed reader that I really
         do wish to be found out. I confess that the morals of the
         thing are a little askew, but at least they are as good as
         Baudelaire's, and the whole thing is a great deal more
         intelligible than the Frenchman's output. I have therefore
         proven that the thing is, on the whole, as good as some things
         in French and English.
      </p>
      	
      <p>But, candidly, Mr. Davis, I rather think I can do something
         in the line of the dramatic poem! Have been trying it. Do
         you think I am wasting my time? I practiced verse long before
         I ever thought of prose; began it when I was twelve years old.
         I have quite a good deal of stuff, begun in the past three
         years, that I think has something in it — maybe not.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Thanking you for your interest in me, I am,</p>
