      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I'm visiting here during a gap in my lecture tour. I'll be here until Nov. 15, when
         I'll do a stunt at Stanford. After that I shall be on the jump until Dec. 12 among
         the universities — colleges of the northwest.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm going to need the Laureate address

      <p>
         
         
         
         on Nov. 15th. If you have not already sent proofs to Branson, please send them here.
         If The Torch Press can't furnish proofs to you by the 10th 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>, I'm going to have to ask that you have the MS sent to me in time for my Stanford
         engagement. I'm sorry to be obliged to do this; but you're a good scout, &amp; I'm sure
         you'll do anything reasonable for me

         as I most certainly would for you.
