<span class="salute">Dear Mott: —</span>


	<p>My outing was a trying business, tho' I appreciated the kindness of the man who took me. It was hard not to be ungrateful, I kept thinking how much more profitable it would have been to spend some of those hours with you. There wasn't an idea in that car nor at Okoboji, and I got back horribly fagged.</p>
	<p>My wife and mother report a fine visit with you, however, and that's some compensation.</p>
	<p>I wanted to give you something, but was too rushed. Which of

my books would you care to receive from me?</p>
	<p>Come again &amp; stay longer, letting me know several weeks ahead so that no one can have any prior claims on me.</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>
