      <p>It was good, as always, to hear from you again. Here's another report you will want.
         Last Sunday evening (1-13) I talked to the Presbyterian Students' Center. There were
         about 80 students present, maybe a few more. We had dinner and then I turned loose
         in the big lounge. They asked me to talk on Spiritual Conceptions of the Sioux, showing
         the relationship of same to essential Christianity. Nothing doctrinal, of course,
         and tending to broaden and illuminate conventional conceptions based upon an alleged
         historical event.

      <p>
         
         Certainly it was not orthodox, but it 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>was religion</u>
      </p>
      <p> — and you should have seen how they sat without a motion and </p>
      <p>
         <u>listened</u>
      </p>
      <p>. I talked more than an hour, and they wanted more. Afterward Rev. Cahill (in charge
         of the activities at the Center) told Mona that in the four years he has been there
         in charge he never saw such a response from the students. A student of mine, who was
         there, told me that after I left, the students did not lark about, as usual, but sat
         about in circles talking earnestly about
         
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">-3-</h6>
      <p>
         
         the affair. This 
      </p>
      <p>seems boastful, and perhaps I should have had Mona tell you, but I'm only reporting
         for your dissertation, if you can use the report.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The little affair is typical in the matter of method (quite unplanned). The original
         approach is wholly informal, almost casual, or quite so. But something vital to the
         purpose is being said all the while. And then the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>change</u>
      </p>
      <p> comes — that "click". After that they are </p>
      <p>
         <u>mine</u>
      </p>
      <p> and I am theirs, and what is said </p>
      <p>
         <em>feels</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>good</u>
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">-4-</h6>
      <p>
         
         as it is said — and feels unquestionably 
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>true</em>
      </p>
      <p> also. There is really no technique — just a loss of self in </p>
      <p>
         <u>them</u>
      </p>
      <p> and the </p>
      <p>
         <u>ideas</u>
      </p>
      <p>, along with a glow like affection. They seem </p>
      <p>
         <em>dear</em>
      </p>
      <p>. Do forgive this seeming vanity. It's only seeming, really.</p>
