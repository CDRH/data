      <div class="salute">My dear Mrs. Berg:- </div>
      
      
      <p>I don't know that I succeeded in letting you know how much I appreciate yours and
         the Doctor's kindness during my brief stay in Pender. You were both so good to me,
         and I felt at home with you both, as though I had known you for years. I wish the
         Doctor might have been with us at Calhoun, but I know that he couldn't get away. Didn't
         we  have a bully time? Weather planned especially for us! After leaving you there,
         I had a dismal week of it, sitting for the portrait in a stuffy studio with the mercury
         in the nineties.

         Photography is certainly a more humane art than painting - from the sitter's standpoint.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm back at work on "The Song of the Indian Wars" again, and it looks as tho' I'd
         have a good run with it the rest of the summer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Please give my regards to Mrs. Graves.</p>
