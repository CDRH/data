      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I have been having some difficulty with Brown of Macmillans over the school edition
         of the WARS. He actually made me this proposition: To issue the Friends, Glass and
         the Wars in one volume of over 600 pages, my royalty to be the same as I now receive
         on the Friends-Glass volume. This was, of course, ridiculous. He kept insisting that
         the "trilogy" should be in one volume. I have at length made him understand that there
         is no "trilogy"; that there is no reason in the world why Wars and the other poems
         should be in one volume, and that the Wars will be, in fact, the third volume of the
         completed cycle, the second volume containing the Migration and Jed Smith. Now he
         writes me as though he had suddenly been illuminated, and it seems that we are to
         have the Wars in a single volume. I think there is little reason to doubt now. Seaver
         is away, and when he returns the two will decide.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I expect to begin my vacation July 23rd - three weeks. It will be a pleasure to edit
         STRAWS IN THE WIND, with Enid to help.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How is the Book coming on?</p>

      <p>I hope that if Lovett does anything, which seems doubtful, he may have the fairness
         to choose someone outside the prejudiced New York bunch of petty politicians.
