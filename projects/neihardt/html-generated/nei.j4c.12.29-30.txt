      <p>I see that in my haste I failed to reply to your question as to books for your School
         Library. Here is the best possible answer I can give:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Get from E.P. Dutton + Co., New York, their complete list of Everyman's Library.</p>
      
      
      <p>Get from Henry Holt + Co their complete list of the Home University Library.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the American-Scandinavian Foundation (25 West 45th St., N.Y) get list of their
         publications from G.P. Prutman's Sons, N.Y., get list of Loeb Library.
      </p>
      
      <h6 class="fw">30</h6>
      
      
      <h6 class="fw">-2-</h6>
      
      <p>With these lists before you, it will be easy for 
         <u>you</u> to check 
         <del class="what">what</del> suitable volumes.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Also, get from E.P. Dutton + Co. list of the New Universal Library (pub. abroad by
         Routledge, London) (This 
         <u>may</u> be out of print but I think not)
      </p>
      
      
      <p>These "libraries" are, as you know, the best going and cover a wide range. Also, with
         exception of Loeb Library + The
         <del class="S">S</del> American-Scandinavian publications, prices are reasonable. All are well made books
         and good editions. You can't go wrong on these lists.
      </p>
