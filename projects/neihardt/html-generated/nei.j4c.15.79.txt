                <p>Here is another item in the case of Pattee against common Honesty:</p>
                    
                    <p>If the gentleman, far from taking the trouble of reading my Cycle before rendering judgement thereon, has merely looked into the Drinkwater-Canby-Benet anthology of English poetry or, better still, into the Quinn-Baugh-Howe work, the Literature of America, he could have learned with little effort how foolish the professorial Greek-imitation charge is. These are only two anthologies (both standard) that he might have consulted.</p>
