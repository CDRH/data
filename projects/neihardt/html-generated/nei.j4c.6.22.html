      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Braithwaite: - </div>
      
      	
      <p>You have a great idea, and I am persuaded to believe it will work. Herewith I send
         you my agreement.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Frankly, I do not know what would be an intelligent figure for the moving picture
         rights, and as I have perfect faith in your integrity, I would prefer to leave that
         matter to your judgement. Would a royalty net be better for both us than a lump sum?
         This, too, I leave to you.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Just now I am so soused in a new  book that I can't well undertake the task of making
         the outlines of the stories. I remember the skill with which you retold the "Glass"
         yarn, and I am sure you can present the plots quite as effectively as I could. If
         you care to assume this task, I am quite willing that you should have a more liberal
         commission.
      </p>
      	
      <p>If the narratives are accepted for screen production, I will want to contribute something
         to the making of the scenarios, as I am probably more familiar with the background
         than anyone back there, and could add certain details that would fill out the plots
         and increase the dramatic appeal from the "movie" standpoint. Please make this a point
         in presenting the material.
      </p>
      
      	
      <p>I want to thank you for the very generous article you gave to Dr. House's book. You
         have long been a tower of strength to American poets, and I, for one, am deeply grateful.
      </p>
