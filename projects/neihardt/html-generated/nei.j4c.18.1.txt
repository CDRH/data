      <p>Many thanks for the pictures. They're magnificent! And I'm glad for the picture of
         the Society's quarters where so many have been and shall be really happy together.
         Mona and I carried the warm glow of that evening with us all the way home â€” and did
         we need it, with the snow heaped high and the mercury trying to get out at the bottom
         of the thermometer!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>We had a good time at Grinnell in spite of the big snowstorm, which cut down my crowd
         somewhat. But they haven't the S. P. C. S. spirit over there by a good deal! Very
         pleasant and appreciative people, however.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It 
         <u>was</u> bully to be with you again, and Mona and I do hope that you and Mrs. Mott will visit
         us before too long. I think we'd really have a good time together.
      </p>
