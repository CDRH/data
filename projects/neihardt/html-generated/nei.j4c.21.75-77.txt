      <p>Thanks for the invitation to be a guest in your home after June 8. I will return from
         Yankton about June 7, and then I can come to you for a week or more. I think this
         is a good plan, as it will save you much coming and going. I do hope, however, that
         we may be at Skyrim once or twice. If we give our time to the job, much can be done
         in even one week.
      </p>

      <p>Alice &amp; the children will be leaving (with a load of horses) next Wednesday. (This
         is Sunday). I'm glad I can tell the children I'll be coming down to them in a short
         while.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm reading the MS — Chap IV. 
         <u>Good job</u>! Two or three corrections as to facts — easy to make. Will pass the MS on to Dr. Reid.
