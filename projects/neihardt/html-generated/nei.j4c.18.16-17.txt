      <p>It was bully to receive yours of December 25th.</p>
      
      
      <p>Of course I'll write Lewis, as you wish, and it will not be difficult, as I feel that
         his idea is undoubtedly good and that he will be able to handle it in an effective
         way.

      <p>The news about Morrie Ryskind delights me. I am so glad for Mary, and I hope that
         some of the people in Wayne, who really meant no harm but were only petty, know all
         about her and her husband. Not long ago, Mona and I saw MY MAN GODFREY and we got a real kick out of it. I noted with pleasure that Ryskind had a hand in
         the making of that picture. It's hard for me to understand how in hell any man can
         make that much money, but since we are living in a sort of dog-fight civilization,
         I throw my hat in the air for any man who can make plenty of what it takes.

      <p>I suppose you would be unhappy if you were in California with nothing to do but live and twiddle your thumbs,
         although I should think that you could be digging things out of yourself in between
         thumb-twiddlings. Surely you have more than one book in your system. I do hope that you will get the
         book you now have in hand as you want it, and see no reason why you should not. There
         ought to be a place for it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You ask who would be likely to take my place here if I should leave to do my work.
         That question gave me an idea which might be worth considering, and I think you know
         what the idea is. I cannot yet have any definite plans as to when I can begin on THE
         SONG OF JED SMITH, but I know that I shall begin before too long. At present, I have
         in mind the possibility of putting over a number of things with the movies. One of
         the big firms is considering THE DAWN BUILDER, which I believe has the

         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="elements​ ">elemtns</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         ​ of a corking movie in it. If I could get by with this or with any one of a half-dozen
         of my short stories, I could probably 
      </p>
      <p>push the Cycle, and there is certainly good stuff in that--especially in THE SONG
         OF THE MESSIAH, as I have it schemed for a movie. It seems possible that I may get
         hold and if I do, you could imagine how long I'd be in this smok
      </p>
      <p>y city. I'm not unhappy here and certainly it's a lovely job in every way. But there
         are better things to do.

         I have a chance to go to Buffalo University and to a women's college in New York State
         sometime in the late winter. Perhaps it will be possible to hook these up with an
         engagement in Charleston, but if I did not go any other place, I'd like to lecture
         in Charleston, so that you and I might have an old-time powwow.

      <p>I am about to give the final reading to that page, and it will have to be goodbye
         for now. You may be sure of my enduring love.
