      <p>Hurrah for your granddaughter!! It's quite a wonderful experience, I know; for I remember
         the arrival of our first one. (She is married now — think of it!)

      <p>I had not heard about your brother's accident. Owing to a long spell of bad weather
         I did not visit with the watchmen, as usual, so didn't know until your letter came.
         Mona and I went to the hospital and had a good visit. We found H B looking well and

         he said he wasn't worrying because all his expenses will be paid by his University
         insurance and Blue Cross. Incidentally, when telling us this, he remarked that even
         if his insurance didn't pay 'my brother would take care of it — you bet he would'!
         It was just an opportunity to express his profound faith in you and his affection.
         We will see him again shortly. The break is
