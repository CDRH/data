<span class="salute">Dear Davis:—</span>

	<p>I am glad to learn that Bigelow is the right sort,
and I feel that you are a good judge of the breed of men, being
a Westerner and naturally having that sort of a big heart which
beats in vast spaces. I surely want to meet Bigelow. I have
it from another friend that he is a remarkable man.</p>
	<p>It will be easy for me to like all these fellows, if they
can only like me.</p>
	<p>Glad to hear that Richard Duffy is now on the Munsey staff.
He was friendly to me when he was with Watson's.</p>
	<p>I am hoping that "The Alien" may appear soon — before
March first, or not later than that. It is quite necessary
that it be a part of my short story volume. You may be sure
that Munsey's will get the proper credit.</p>
	<p>The American Magazine is quite apt to print one or two
of the stories which have not been sold. "Nature and Zephyr
Recontre", the story which you liked but considered unsuitable
for Munsey, may be printed in the American within the next
three months. Phillips has been kind enough to take considerable
interest in the stories.</p>
