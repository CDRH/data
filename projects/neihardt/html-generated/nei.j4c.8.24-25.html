      <p>I've caught up with my journal work and am beginning again on "The Song of the Indian
         Wars" after a month's interruption it always takes several days to get back into the
         mood of the thing; and just now I am at one of those transition points where the going
         is more than ordinarily efficient easy transitions are nearly half the battle.

      <p> is the important thing. I'm getting the feel of it in fine shape, however, and expect
         to be moving on nicely by tomorrow morning.

         I had a perfectly bully time up there, and a very profitable one for the work. What
         wonderful friends I have! - and you are of the best. If such friendships were merely
         personal, I would feel like an impostor; but I know that you and the others are more
         keen to help the work along than to show your friendship for John Neihardt, who, without
         the work, would deserve little. That is the way it should be. We are doing something
         together; and nothing worth doing is likely to be done alone!

      <p>It was a lucky day Mr. Master, when you threw your hat into the ring - lucky for the
         work and for me as the worker.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was delighted to find Mrs. Masters' verses at the head of an article on the Calhoun
         affair. I think she has been unnecessarily modest, having never said a word to me
         about her own efforts that is an exceptionally clever but of occasional verse, and
         anyone who can do that can do a great deal more. It would interest me greatly to know
         how much she has written and what she is going

         to do with it. During a year I receive a good many manuscripts from Parnassus climbers,
         and almost always the case is hopeless. Those who can do things seem to know the truth
         and do not strenuously seek confirmation of their hopes except by more work. The others
         clamor piteously for encouragement.

      <p>It is beastly hot here; but I know where there is a pool of coolness, and I'm there
         every afternoon at four with three youngsters and sometimes a grandma. The mama can't
         go in; which is a pity.
