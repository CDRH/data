      <p>I missed some points in answering your letter yesterday.</p>
      
      
      <p>Of course I shall be glad to autograph the book for your friend.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'd love to visit you and lecture there; but I cannot know yet when I may be sent
         back to the Pine Ridge Reservation to get a book for Macmillans. Expect to hear soon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I've been reading the Upson Number. Yes, it is enough and beautifully done. Russell
         and Jones are very real persons. You should feel that you have done a good deed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Regardless of what he says about my stuff, Coolidge is no fool, believe me. You should
         cultivate him as a contributor. His explanation of the popular vogue for "Trees" is,
         I feel sure, correct. Several years ago I gave the same explanation, but I'm sure
         he is unaware of the fact.
