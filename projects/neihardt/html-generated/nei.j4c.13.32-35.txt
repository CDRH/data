         few precious moments with the beloved poet, John G. Neihardt, a golden milestone in
         memory's treasure-logs? You see I have been one of the unfortunate flu victims. Pictures
         and the "after effects" are 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>not so good</u>
      </p>
      <p>, — so this faithful </p>
      <p>
         <em>pen</em>
      </p>
      <p> of mine has had a long rest - </p>
      <p>
         <u>also</u>

      <p>! I </p>
      <p>
         <u>have</u>
      </p>
      <p> written you once before </p>

         <span class="">[were so?]</span>
      </p>
      <p> gracious as to like the poem, "Success" I enclosed in that letter -</p> 
      
      
      <p>Long years ago, when a child I lived in far away Montana,

         first at Ft. Caster - later at an Indian Trading Post - on the Big Horn River. Huntley
         is the name in that village - Indians were the principal inhabitants in those long
         ago years I learned to 
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="">[know them well?]</span>
      </p>
      <p> + they called my young and beautiful mother, "The White Angel". I am wondering if
         by any chance

      <p>
         <span class="">[Mr.?]</span>
      </p>
      <p> Neihardt was ever at Ft. Custer or Huntley - Of course, </p>
      <p> it is all very different out then now compared to forty years ago!</p>

      <p>John G. Neihardt is wonderful — Nebraska — and the whole world have reasons to be
         very proud of him! One of the finest things, in my own humble opinion that this friend
         who has "The Heart of a 
         <u>Man</u> &amp; the soul of a Poet"
         <span class="">[?]</span> wrote
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Prayer for Pain" - you may know the poem, but just to be sure, when I write you again,
         I shall enclose the lines.
