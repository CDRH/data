      <p>I think you will be glad to hear that THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS is finished at last.
         Allen True, the mural painter is working on drawings for a 
         <u>de-luxe</u> edition which Macmillan will bring out in January shortly before the trade edition
         is published. True known Indians and the West, and there is every reason to believe
         that he will make a very beautiful book. There will be a cover design, and sheets,
         title page, initial letters and fourteen full page drawings - not illustrations of
         particular incidents, but illustrations of the mood of the WARS. True has been working
         with Brangwyn in England on some big mural stuff, but is now resting in Italy. He
         calls working on my book recreation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I feel pretty sure that you will regard the WARS as my best thing in every way . .
         . . . . . . .
