      <p>It's great news that we are to have you here, and all of us are glad. We have a little
         room for you and can make you comfortable. I must tell you just how things are 
      </p>

      <p> here. My office hours are from 9:15 to 4:30. I take the 8:05 train here in the morning
         and the 5 o'clock train in the evening, arriving home at about 5:30. There is no chance
         to do anything but work during the

      <p>days. After supper we will be free, and I wish we could have one Sunday - my only
         free day.

         You see my column runs seven days of the week.

      <p>I can't be encouraging in the matter of your connecting with the P-D. It is the mark
         at which ambitious newspapermen are always aiming. I have met a number of people who
         are eager for a job on the P-D. As to editorials, you would make a good editorial
         writer without a question. You'd be excellent after you got licked into journalistic
         shape, and that might be a punishing experience. There are four editorial writers
         on the P-D, and the page is rated as one of the best in America. It is

         and very hard to reach. These jobs are sewed up in complicated ways. Merit, in this
         world, is not the determining thing at all. Something comes before merit. Ability
         is really not very scarce, considering the relatively small number of jobs demanding
         it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As for reviewing, there is none of that, now that I am running a daily column.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Times-Star, across the street from the P-D, is a paper that is fighting for its
         life against the Titan Post-Dispatch and The Globe Democrat, which latter, tho' a
         bad second, is very strong. You might manage to connect with the Times-Star, but I
         am unacquainted there.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm wondering if you are not still interested in our Macmillan scheme - you their
         man on the road, with your book published by them. That seems a good scheme to me,
         if it can be put through.

         <em>you</em>

      <p> were to get a job of editorial writing. You'd be hog-tied as to opinion, and </p>
