                <span class="salute">Dear Bob:</span>
                
                <p>I was both surprised and delighted to hear from you. I have often thought of you in a frame-work of the old times when we were youngsters, but I know only that you were still in business in Omaha.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, Bancroft is a bit saddening. It used to be such a bustling town — especially on Saturdays — and when I was there an hour with Rollie Ley of Wayne a year ago, it seemed a bit like a graveyard.

                    Still, it's Bancroft and dear for its memories.</p>
                <p>You speak of Mrs. K's passing. I used to look at her with admiration in the old days, for she was beautiful. And your gallant, fine old dad! There was a man, by golly — a real one!</p>
              
                <p>So there is a Bancroft news to take the place of my old Blade! And you contribute! Interesting stuff, too. Thanks for your thought of me and my pals of the river adventure. That <del/>was

                    47 years ago! You mention Yellowstone Kelly, <u>your great uncle</u>! I know a good deal about him, from his old friend, Capt. Grant P. Marsh, who was my friend too. Have you read Kelly's biography? Have you read <u>The Conquest of the Missouri</u>? The latter is Marsh's life story, &amp; tells about Kelly. (It was I who found a publisher for <u>The Conquest of the Missouri</u>.)

                    I have a fine photo of your great uncle, given to me by Capt. Marsh. Marsh was in command of the Far West in the Custer campaign, &amp; brought Reno's wounded down to Ft. Abraham Lincoln.</p>
