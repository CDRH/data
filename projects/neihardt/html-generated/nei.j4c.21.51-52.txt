      <p>Before I forget, here is another note on the "flaming" socialist "paradox". 
         
         <u>Paradox</u> is right, as you say; and a bit later you show that you meant 
         <del class=""></del>
         
         <u>paradox</u> and not 
         <u>discrepancy</u>. In one of my articles I pointed out the discrepancy between the radical socialist
         position of certain alleged poets of 
         <u>the masses</u> school and their 
         <u>anarchic</u> theory of poetry. The social position connoted an insistence on a high state of organization,
         forming but in the arts they were violently opposed to form, technically and philosophically.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This is a good point.</p>
