                <p>Before I forget, here is another note on the "flaming" socialist "paradox". 
                <u>Paradox</u> is right, as you say; and a bit later you show that you meant <del/>
                <u>paradox</u> and not <u>discrepancy</u>. In one of my articles I pointed out the discrepancy between the radical socialist position of certain alleged poets of <u>the masses</u> school and their <u>anarchic</u> theory of poetry. The social position connoted an insistence on a high state of organization, forming but in the arts they were violently opposed to form, technically and philosophically.</p>
               
                <p>This is a good point.</p>
