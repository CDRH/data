      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I am sincerely pleased with the quality and appearance of the first number of the
         Quarterly. The format is dignified, as it should be, and I can see easily that as
         to make-up you are bound in the right direction. Appearance is a very great deal,
         for God knows this is pretty much an eye world for even the majority of intelligent
         people. Your first number had to be scant and sketchy under the circumstances. That
         will be remedied in the next, and the thing will grow. I wish it could be at least
         a bi-monthly; but that may come too. A monthly would be ideal; but where to get the
         time? This may easily develop, with your well-grounded enthusiasm, into something that will justify your College in giving you more time
         for a really important task. Very important things might be done for New River. As
         it is, I think it a very fine thing that your people there have backed you in such
         a scheme. They are making no mistake, and they will be glad.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am particularly delighted to know that you have a constructive job of this size
         to keep your mind and spirit on the stretch. It's bully. Don't feel that you must
         give very much space on me -- just what I may seem to deserve along with the others
         who are sincere and have something to say.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm unreasonably crowded by my P-D job. Even my boss - a hard, shrewd veteran journalist
         -- said before a company the other day that he "couldn't see how Neihardt does so
         much work". If I do anything for you, it must be good. I doubt if I can do a special
         thing on Robinson. He calls for something well considered; but could you not use some
         little essay of mine already published, but still significant? There'd be no trouble
         with the paper that used it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>By all means, write Dr. Alexander, asking for an essay on American Indian Song, and
         tell him that I urged you to do so. He will give you a fine thing. Also, write Dr.
         Boodin at the University Club, Los Angeles, California for a paper on contemporary
         philosophy, and tell him I urged you to write him. He too will respond, and what he
         give will be golden. By all means have a good article on Boodin's philosophy, especially
         his latest book. Some good man at Carleton would undoubtedly contribute this. Write
         the president of Carleton what you want asking him to hand the letter to someone in
         his faculty.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I can give you a lot of such leads, and will as soon as my flu-woozy head clears up.
         I was knocked down by flu last Tuesday, and am only now recovering.
      </p>
