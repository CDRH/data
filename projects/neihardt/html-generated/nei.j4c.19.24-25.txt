      <div class="salute">Dear Friends: </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm really ashamed that I haven't written you for so long a time; but you may be sure
         that all my thoughts of you  — and there have been many — were affectionate and grateful
         ones. This has been rather a distracting sort of winter for me, as for most people,
         altho' I have no complaints to make. On the contrary, I am deeply grateful for so
         very much.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm afraid the St. Louis agency did not realize conditions — both of mind and purse
         — among people generally. Around defense centers, there is a false sense of prosperity
         that misleads. If we had gone ahead with our smaller ideas, there might have been
         more or less of a Nebraska trip, though I don't feel sure. As it is, I 
         <u>may</u> go to several places, and I may not. It doesn't really matter in the least. My feeling
         for you two 
         <u>does</u> matter, and it is much auged.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I've just returned from another visit (my third)</p>
      <p> at Kemper Military School. </p>

         Five hundred fine young men, most of them in training to be 2nd lieuts!

      <p>I do hope things are going reasonably well for you. Are you, Elmer, likely to get
         into some good defense job? I've been trying through Lowell Mellet since a year ago
         last December. Mellet is one of the "upstairs cabinet", you know. He seems to want
         to use me; but there must be a ludicrous state of confusion in Washington.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Golly! What a world they've made of it!</p>
      
      
      <p>Anyway, there 
         <u>are</u> values that matter.
