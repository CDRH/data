      <div class="salute">Dear Old Man:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>How's everything with you? Are you reasonably happy? Can you work yet? What do you
         find worth while doing these hot days?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wrote you some time ago, in reply to Enid's &amp; Sigurd's letter &amp; in acknowledgement
         of the pretty shells.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Drop me a line.</p>
      
      
      <p>How I have been working to have you here, now that my vacation is on! We could tramp
         over to the Missouri &amp; spend some days &amp; nights in the timber, 
         <del class=""></del> and swim together in my river!
      </p>

      <p>I hadn't half enough of you, Sterling. Your stay was too short. "Hugh Glass" goes
         on 
         <span class="">[finaly?]</span>. I work three or four hours in the morning &amp; do odd jobs about the place during the
         rest of the day. 100° in the shade here now! Good luck, Old Man!
      </p>
