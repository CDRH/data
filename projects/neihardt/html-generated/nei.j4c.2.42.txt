<span class="salute">Dear Old Man:—</span>


<p>How's everything with you? Are you reasonably happy? Can you work yet? What do you find worth while doing these hot days?</p>
    
<p>I wrote you some time ago, in reply to Enid's &amp; Sigurd's letter &amp; in acknowledgement of the pretty shells.</p>
    
<p>Drop me a line.</p>
    
<p>How I have been working to have you here, now that my vacation is on! We could tramp over to the Missouri &amp; spend some days &amp; nights in the timber, <del/> and swim together in my river!</p>

<p>I hadn't half enough of you, Sterling. Your stay was too short. "Hugh Glass" goes on <span class="unclear ">[finaly?]</span>. I work three or four hours in the morning &amp; do odd jobs about the place during the rest of the day. 100° in the shade here now! Good luck, Old Man!</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Yours always,</span>
    
<br/>Jno.
