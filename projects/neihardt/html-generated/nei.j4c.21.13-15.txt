      <p>During the past three days I have been hungrily reading your 
         <u>Hamilton</u> — a fine experience; and I am most grateful to you. I wish you had put your name
         on the fly-leaf; but perhaps you will do so next summer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Surely the man emerges clearly from the pages of your book, and I am richer for knowing

      <p> That's it! That 
         was what was the matter with me when I was a Socialist. It has been the same with
         me in the conception of all values, from those of common sense up through esthetics,
         ethics, religion.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You've done a lot of good, Aly. Many thanks!</p>
