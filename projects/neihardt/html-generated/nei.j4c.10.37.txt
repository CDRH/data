<span class="salute">My dear Mr. and Mrs. Masters:-</span>

<p>Thanks for the letters. Many thanks for the labor at McGregor! Too bad you had so small a crowd. I had reason to suppose that you would have a goodly gathering. Now I am sorry I urged you to go. I certainly do not like to see you wasted.</p>

<p>I am connected in an honorary way with a number of poetry magazines, the best of which is the quarterly, VERSE, of Philadelphia. It pays real money for verse, and it seems to me to be the best all-poetry magazine in the country. I shall have nothing to give it, of course; but I want to help along. Surely you, Mrs. Masters, have some things you could let me see. And would not our friend who wrote "Roof Pigeons" send me a bunch of things? Also, if you ever run across good verse, let me know.</p>

<span class="salute">Every kind thought,</span>
