      <p>That's nice of the Chicago Poetry Circle. If they can arrange to have the dinner on
         Monday, May 6, I can arrange to be there. There's another possibility during the last
         week of April, but May 6 would fit the pattern much better. I want to see you and Mrs. Seymour, and I want to see "the boys and girls" of the Poetry Circle. As for expenses, I do all my rather extensive traveling by car, and if they could let loose of enough to make 2 cents a mile for 1000 miles we'd
         let the car stand the rest of the damage.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I was just on the point of sending you that photo you wanted. It's going now.</p>
