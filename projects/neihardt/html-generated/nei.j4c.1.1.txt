      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Davis: </div>
      
      
      
      <div class="lg">
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <div class="l">And shall I grow as fat as you, my friend in old New York? </div>
            
            <div class="l">Eat capon? Ever pull with pride the plutocratic cork? </div>
            
            <div class="l">My ship rides in the offing with a windless idle sail; </div>
            
            <div class="l">I have not hit the pace that counts; I have not hit the nail. </div>
            
            <div class="l">Yet, tho' I'm lean, and tho' you eat and drink the stuff that fats, </div>
            
            <div class="l">God bless you with your Burgundy — I stick to Wiener-Blatz! </div>
             
         </div>
         
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <div class="l">Out here amid the wind-blown corn we eat the festive swine; </div>
            
            <div class="l">We eat him with the hair on, and we don't know much of wine. </div>
            
            <div class="l">The capon that shall fatten me has not yet felt the knife; </div>
            
            <div class="l">He hasn't made his crow before the footlights of this life. </div>
            
            <div class="l">He's still a mystic riddle in an egg as yet unlaid, </div>
            
            <div class="l">And his mother hasn't even cackled yet; I am afraid! </div>

            <div class="l">Is still a latent dampness in the sunny slopes of France, </div>
            
            <div class="l">A thrill among the vineyard roots, a dream of sun and dew! </div>
            
            <div class="l">But I am glad to hear, my friend, it is not so with you. </div>
            
            <div class="l">For tho' I'm forced to thinner founts than those that cheer and fat you, </div>
            
            <div class="l">God send you wine! </div>
            
            <div class="l">PROST! </div>
            
            <div class="l">O'er a stein, kind friend, I'm lookin' at you! </div>

      <p>P. S. I will bother you with a story or two soon. I am working on a book manuscript
         which interests me quite a good deal.—
