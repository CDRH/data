      <p>Well, it seems that I'll have to go to St. Louis after all. They have wired me three
         times in the past three days, and want me to begin as soon as possbile. My problem
         now is to get free of the Journal-Post, and, of course, I intend to do so. The St.
         Louis Post-Dispatch is a world paper, and I can't afford to let the chances go, though
         only two weeks ago I made a verbal agreement with the Journal-Post. I expect to be
         working in St. Louis in two weeks at the latest.
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="note">I'd send you the books, after asking you, in each case, if you might be interested.</div>
      
      
      <p>Will you do some reviews for me? The Post-Dispatch pays space rates - now much that
         is I don't know. The J-P agreed to let me pay as much as $10 per col. I should think
         the Post-Dispatch might allow as much. I'd want you to have a shot at especially good
         works in your special field. Would you enjoy this?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>And I'll see you at Christmas when you come over for that convention! Hurrah!</p>
