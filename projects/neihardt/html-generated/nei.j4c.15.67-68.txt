      <p>Mr. Pulitzer just wired, granting leave of absence, but stating that the column will
         be discontinued during my vacation. This was a great surprise to me and very disappointing,
         for I did very much want to give you this look-in. I'll be at my book on August first.
         Perhaps the gods want you to feel the soil of Greece under your feet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm quite sure that if there was to be a substitute it would be you.</p>
