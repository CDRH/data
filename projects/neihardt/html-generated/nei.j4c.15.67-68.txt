                <p>Mr. Pulitzer just wired, granting leave of absence, but stating that the column will be discontinued during my vacation. This was a great surprise to me and very disappointing, for I did very much want to give you this look-in. I'll be at my book on August first. Perhaps the gods want you to feel the soil of Greece under your feet.</p>
               
                <p>I'm quite sure that if there was to be a substitute it would be you.</p>
