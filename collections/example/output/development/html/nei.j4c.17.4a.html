                </span>
                <p>My two daughters, Hilda and Enid, are planning to enter State Teachers College this fall. Hilda, who has just completed the high school here, expects to enter the School of Journalism at the University after two years in your college. Enid has completed a secretarial course and intends to continue in that work later.</p>

         <del>Will you p</del>
         <span class="tei_add">P</span>lease send me the State Teachers College bulletin; and if you have any suggestions <span class="tei_add">to make</span> as to what courses my daughters should study in view of the work they intend to do, I should be very grateful.</p>
