#    CONFIGURATION FOR ALL COLLECTIONS     #
############################################

# Note:  if you make changes to this file you are potentially altering
#   every collection
#   It is recommended that you override only those parts that you need in
#   the collection specific configuration files (collections/name/config/config.yml)
#   For example, you will need a solr_core name for each collection
#   You may place the settings under development / production if the environments
#   differ, but you may put things outside of development / production if the
#   setting will be the same for both.  The script locations below are applied to
#   both development and production, but if you need to run a different script for
#   each environment, you could copy whichever script override you need into
#   development and production
