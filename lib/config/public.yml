#    CONFIGURATION FOR ALL COLLECTIONS     #
############################################

# Note:  be very careful when editing this file as it will affect all collections
#   using this version of the datura gem without specific overrides
#
#   It is recommended that you override only those parts that you need in
#   the collection specific configuration files:
#   (config/public.yml and config/private.yml)


###################
#     Defaults    #
###################

default:

  # SCRIPT POWER
  # recommend this be increased in private.yml
  # on more powerful systems to improve runtime
  threads: 5

  # LOGGING
  log_old_number: 1           # number of log files before beginning to erase
  log_size: 1024000           # size of log file in bytes
  log_level: Logger::INFO     # change to INFO for more detail

  # SCHEMA LOCATION
  # misleadingly, this is not currently overrideable per collection
  # TODO make overrideable in es_set_schema and post
  # or perhaps remove it from this config since it is not collection-specific
  # in any sense of the word, except if working with an entirely separate ES index
  es_schema_path: lib/config/api_schema.yml

  # RESOURCE LOCATIONS
  data_base: https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu      # xml, csv, html snippets, etc
  media_base: https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu     # images, audio, video
  es_index: override_to_set_index           # elasticsearch index name
  es_path: http://localhost:9200            # elasticsearch path (recommend override)
  solr_core: override_to_set_core           # solr core name
  solr_path: http://localhost:8983/solr     # solr path (recommend override)

  # OUTPUT LOCATION
  # default is [environment]/output/[file_type]
  # override behavior by overriding ruby code in file_type.rb or subclasses

  # INCLUDE SPECIFIC FILES (EXCLUDE NON SPECIFIED)
  # if specified, then ALL scripts will only process
  # files which exactly match a line of the file
  # feel free to name the file anything you want as long as it's .txt
  # allowed_files: config/allowed.txt

  # XSLT SCRIPT LOCATIONS
  # to solr
  tei_solr_xsl: scripts/.xslt/tei_to_solr/tei_to_solr.xsl

  #   copy over ALL of them in that group to the collection specific config file
  # variables passed in automatically to both of the following:
  #   - collection
  #   - data_base
  #   - media_base
  #   - environment
  variables_html:
    site_url:
    image_large: 800
